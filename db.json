Yet, not every idea is going to be feasible. Constructive and effective idea feedback starts before you ask for an idea, and it should be specific, goal-oriented, focused on the future, clear and honest, looks at the process, and is about the idea, not the person.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\n## The Struggle Of Idea Feedback\n Any ideation process is going to have ideas arrive that mean well, or might even be brilliant ideas, but for some reason are out of reach. They could be overly ambitious, require resources you don’t have access to, or are just a bit out of step with the intended approach.\n\n Yet, any commitment to this process means you have to [discuss these ideas honestly and clearly](https://online.champlain.edu/blog/giving-constructive-feedback). Fortunately, it’s easy if you keep a few key points in mind.\n\n## Setting The Stage\n When launching a process, or moving into a new stage of your ideation strategy, a good place to start is by setting the right expectations. This will give you more focused ideas and make feedback easier to offer.\n\n  - *Have a clear process*: Before you ask for ideas, it should be clear what process ideas go through, what’s involved in each step, and what filters are applied to ideas. If people understand the process first, they’ll both be more engaged with it, and if an idea is filtered out, they will better grasp precisely what happened.\n  - *Offer specific goals and timelines*: The ultimate goal of the process should be clear, and the more specific the goal, the better. For example, [NASA saved millions of dollars and months of development](https://ideascale.com/24571-2/) by making clear precisely what they needed for a new liquid measuring system, as it was already in development elsewhere in the organization. A specific goal saved some potential frustration, as well as time and money.\n  - *Layout limits and advantages*: In many cases, good ideas arrive but can’t be put into practice as the submitter doesn’t know exactly what’s at the team’s disposal. Putting out certain clear limits and advantages, such as overall budget, attempts to keep the process internal, or that you need ideas that can be executed within a specific timeline, will help direct creativity towards the needed places.\n  - *Set expectations*: Most of us understand that not every idea is going to make it through any process. But setting that expectation clearly, and also setting expectations for what people who submit ideas will get out of the process will help with the feedback process when ideas arrive.\n\nSo, when the inbox begins filling, how should you reply? Here are six tips to use as idea feedback guidance:\n\n![](AdobeStock_269985102_600x.jpg)\n\n## 1. It’s About The Idea, Not The Person\n Good feedback starts with the idea itself. You should lay out in your feedback your thoughts on the idea, particularly if they’re positive. Then make it clear what the roadblocks might be, presented in such a way that perhaps the person can develop the idea further. If, for example, an idea uses many resources that you just don’t have, you might lay that out with some thoughts on how to gain those resources or scale the idea to what you currently have.\n\n## 2. Get Specific\n Specificity is important for a number of reasons. First, being specific shows that you didn’t dismiss the idea out of hand but rather really considered it and how it fits into the overall strategy you’re taking on. That eases any sting at the idea being set aside.\n\n Secondly, specific feedback, especially in a place where feedback is shared and read over, not only helps guide that specific idea but other ones as well. Point out where in the process the idea left this specific conversation, and if appropriate, offer some thoughts on how it might be able to get through that process. It’s also useful when you look back, as you can spot potential issues ideas are stumbling over.\n\n![](AdobeStock_183118681_600x.jpg)\n\n## 3. Be Honest But Not Blunt\n Sometimes the answer to an idea is simply “no,” no matter how good it is. Other times it may be “possibly yes, but not now.” Regardless of the answer, it shouldn’t be obscure, but you can couch it in a direct way while being respectful. Again, being specific helps here because it shows it’s about the idea and helps the person see the reasoning behind the answer.\n\n If the answer is “yes, but not at the moment,” have a process in place to keep that idea on file or to act on it when appropriate.\n\n## 4. Be Ready To Listen\n Feedback isn’t a one-way street, and the person you’re talking to may have ideas that spin-off from what you say. Take the time to listen to or read their feedback and apply the same process. Sometimes you might find an even better idea in the post-mortem of another one.\n\n![](AdobeStock_223502941_600x.jpg)\n\n## 5. Redirect Where Appropriate\n In some cases, you might get ideas that are great but may be on a different scale than you need. For example, if somebody in the logistics department has an idea about reordering how items are picked and packed, and you’re focused on the five-year plan, look for a way to reroute that idea to somebody who can put it into action.\n\n## 6. Ask For The Next Idea\n No matter how the feedback session ends or in what format, close by asking the person for their next idea or thought. Even if they just have some ideas about the process itself, it’s a concrete way to show you value what they have to say and their creativity. It also helps keep the ideas flowing.\n\n Idea feedback can be a difficult part of the job, but it can also be one of the most rewarding. IdeaScale can help you create an ideation platform that’s fun to use, sets clear standards, and offers transparency at any scale, from committee to industry-wide.\n\n","source":"_posts/work_仕事/6-Tips-on-Giving-Effective-Feedback-to-New-Ideas.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 6 Tips on Giving Effective Feedback to New Ideas\ntags:\n  - Entrepreneur\nsticky: 999\ncomments: true\nlang: en_US\ntoc: true\ntocOpen: true\nindexing: true\nhome_posts_tag: false\ntop: false\ndonate: false\ngeolocation: 'Saitama, Japan'\ncopyright: false\nmathjax: false\nshare: false\nimg: >-\n  /2021/0916/Work_仕事/6-Tips-on-Giving-Effective-Feedback-to-New-Ideas/two-women-having-a-discussion.jpeg.webp\ncategories:\n  - Work_仕事\ndate: 2021-09-16 19:14:49\n---\n SOURCE: https://ideascale.com/tips-on-giving-effective-feedback-to-new-ideas/\n By: Jessica Day\n Published: 2021 September 11\n\n---\n \n{% blockquote %}\n   Encouraging creativity is one of the key challenges of innovation strategy.

An e-commerce website had been designed and developed. Launch had been initiated, and it was abruptly taken offline in mid-air.\n\n I became involved with this project just as the website was launching and advised the decommissioning. This was not a comfortable position for me to take with my new client: advising them to shut down their site.\n\n Pulling it offline was an even more difficult decision for the owner. After all, this was not my client’s hobby. They were expecting this website to provide them with a living.\n\n This project was a typical e-commerce site with one significance difference: the site hosted multiple stores (under a single domain), with a similar look and feel for each. The stores were managed individually, but offered products for sale through a common shopping cart.\n\n It should go without saying that the complexity of the design, development, and deployment almost surpasses comprehension. Creating a “multi-vendor” website is a savagely nontrivial task.\n\n The original quote my new client had recieved from their vendor was a measly $10,000 (a website of this magnitude typically costs in the range of $75-100K). When all was said and done, the final cost jumped to over $25,000. How could the initial estimate be so far off (two times)? This simple answer is that the scope of the project was never properly defined, and gross mismanagement completely ignored front-end and back-end users.\n\n## Management Mayhem\n\n It takes many skillsets to build, deploy, and manage modern websites: project management, graphic design (creative), software engineering, software development, usability testers, website beta test management, marketing, and client management.\n\n As I see it, the cause of most website failures is little or no project management. \"No need to define and manage, lets just build something and see what becomes of the website,\" seems to go the thinking.\n\n The customer in this case learned after the project failure just how blindly they’d gone into site design and how poorly the project was managed. When I asked what happened, the details came pouring out:\n\n - \"There was never a roadmap for the website's design, form, fit, and function.\"\n - \"Page layout design wireframes were never defined and presented to us for review and acceptance.\"\n - \"There was no formal project acceptance criteria provided.\"\n - \"We did not know enough about the design an development process to have any doubts regarding the website vendor's abilities.\"\n - \"We were an experiment for our website vendor.\"\n - \"They learned how manage website development from our project.\"\n - \"During the sixteen months of the project lifecycle, there were many organization changes.\"\n - \"The deploy environment was basically launch the website and see what happens.\"\n - \"We did not know any better, as website development deployment was new to us.\"\n - There had been no bridge between the website customer to the vendor's creative staff. The customer tried to develop \"crude\" graphics to show them the desired look and feel for website. The customer was the designer.\n\n I find the statements from my beleaguered client chilling. Plenty of them give reason enough for website shutdown decisions prior to launch.\n\n## A Ruined Experience\n\n As I mentioned earlier, this website was to provide multi-vendor ecommerce services, where vendors could set up a their own unique shop identities and publish products—including photos—linked to them. This capability required an easy to use content management system. The website was neither alpha or beta tested with users. Instead it was fully launched as a means of testing.\n\n Furthermore, the shopping cart had to hold product orders form multiple vendors. The ordering system had to process orders and notify multiple vendors for product shipment. The website vendor's answer was to use the free and open source CMS Joomla an add-on module called the IXXO Multivendor Shopping Cart designed for guru-level IT personnel, not the casual user.\n\n Pity the poor vendor, thrown through pages on Joomla component pages with weird names like: Banner, D-Mack Recommend Friends, Jumi, and LyftenBloggi.\n\n The site owner tried to support about six early adaptor vendors though the UX nightmare, but they hadn’t seen the content management and multivendor shopping cart administrative pages prior to launch. After more than two weeks of attempting to support early adaptor vendors, things were going nowhere: pulling the website offline was the only solution I could see.\n\n## How The ...?\n\n How did this happen? The one and only website software developer was young and inexperienced. He selected the Joomla and IXXO software for without discussing it with anyone, including the website customer. The website vendor was a creative-centric enterprise with low experience in software development and a void of UX and usability skills.\n\nThe form, fit, and function of the entire website—particularly the content management, multivendor shopping, and the customer interaction—was not shared with the website customer. Sixteen months of design and development more than $25,000 wasted, to say nothing of the lost market opportunity.\n\n## How to Never Do This\n\nBad UX, front-end and back-end, can kill a website. There are finer points (don’t deploy general-purpose software modules for a narrow purpose to save time or money), but more crucially, the client needs to be involved from day one.\n\nEngage a full team of website deployment project members, covering all of the disciplines required. Above all else, have a full-time, experienced UX professional available on the website development team. You can’t start a user experience review two weeks before launch.\n\nIf you ever hear anyone asking, “Hey, can you look over this website? We are just about ready to launch,” be very afraid.","source":"_posts/work_仕事/Bad-UX-dead-on-arrival-website.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Bad UX = dead-on-arrival website\ntags:\n  - migrated from FaceBook\nsticky: 999\ncomments: true\nlang: en_US\ntoc: true\ntocOpen: true\nindexing: true\nhome_posts_tag: false\ntop: false\ndonate: false\ngeolocation: 'Saitama, Japan'\ncopyright: false\nmathjax: false\nshare: false\ncategories:\n  - Work_仕事\ndate: 2013-04-08 16:07:00\n---\n SOURCE: https://uxmag.com/articles/killed-at-launch\n By: Pete Mackie\n Published: 2013 April 05\n\n --- \n # Killed at Launch A complete disregard for user experience leads to drastic action\n \n This actually happened.

When I asked what happened, the details came pouring out:\n\n - \"There was never a roadmap for the website's design, form, fit, and function.\"\n - \"Page layout design wireframes were never defined and presented to us for review and acceptance.\"\n - \"There was no formal project acceptance criteria provided.\"\n - \"We did not know enough about the design an development process to have any doubts regarding the website vendor's abilities.\"\n - \"We were an experiment for our website vendor.\"\n - \"They learned how manage website development from our project.\"\n - \"During the sixteen months of the project lifecycle, there were many organization changes.\"\n - \"The deploy environment was basically launch the website and see what happens.\"\n - \"We did not know any better, as website development deployment was new to us.\"\n - There had been no bridge between the website customer to the vendor's creative staff. The customer tried to develop \"crude\" graphics to show them the desired look and feel for website. The customer was the designer.\n\n I find the statements from my beleaguered client chilling. Plenty of them give reason enough for website shutdown decisions prior to launch.\n\n## A Ruined Experience\n\n As I mentioned earlier, this website was to provide multi-vendor ecommerce services, where vendors could set up a their own unique shop identities and publish products—including photos—linked to them. This capability required an easy to use content management system. The website was neither alpha or beta tested with users. Instead it was fully launched as a means of testing.\n\n Furthermore, the shopping cart had to hold product orders form multiple vendors. The ordering system had to process orders and notify multiple vendors for product shipment. The website vendor's answer was to use the free and open source CMS Joomla an add-on module called the IXXO Multivendor Shopping Cart designed for guru-level IT personnel, not the casual user.\n\n Pity the poor vendor, thrown through pages on Joomla component pages with weird names like: Banner, D-Mack Recommend Friends, Jumi, and LyftenBloggi.\n\n The site owner tried to support about six early adaptor vendors though the UX nightmare, but they hadn’t seen the content management and multivendor shopping cart administrative pages prior to launch. After more than two weeks of attempting to support early adaptor vendors, things were going nowhere: pulling the website offline was the only solution I could see.\n\n## How The ...?\n\n How did this happen? The one and only website software developer was young and inexperienced. He selected the Joomla and IXXO software for without discussing it with anyone, including the website customer. The website vendor was a creative-centric enterprise with low experience in software development and a void of UX and usability skills.\n\nThe form, fit, and function of the entire website—particularly the content management, multivendor shopping, and the customer interaction—was not shared with the website customer. Sixteen months of design and development more than $25,000 wasted, to say nothing of the lost market opportunity.\n\n## How to Never Do This\n\nBad UX, front-end and back-end, can kill a website. There are finer points (don’t deploy general-purpose software modules for a narrow purpose to save time or money), but more crucially, the client needs to be involved from day one.\n\nEngage a full team of website deployment project members, covering all of the disciplines required. Above all else, have a full-time, experienced UX professional available on the website development team. You can’t start a user experience review two weeks before launch.\n\nIf you ever hear anyone asking, “Hey, can you look over this website?

Much of the focus is set on engaging the crowd yet deciding which ideas to take a risk on requires data on the likely impacts and costs. \n{% endblockquote %}\n\n One of the top innovation management topics I run into is evaluating the Return on Investment (ROI) for an idea. In my practice several clients evaluate their ideas based on quantifiable metrics that help their innovation teams to measure the costs and the real value or impact of their solutions. In this article I will provide an overview on how to calculate an idea’s ROI, focusing on an idea that will save employees’ time doing a task (one of the most common solutions suggested in employee open innovation campaigns). This calculation can be both a simple and a comprehensive process depending on the complexity of the project’s intended solution. What’s important is that calculating ROI for an idea makes sense for your business, your leadership and is a process that can be applied consistently across a variety of promising ideas and innovation decisions.\n\n## Introduction to ROI\n Calculating the ROI can serve as a valuable exercise to understand whether one of your open innovation campaign’s ideas should be developed into a project and whether a project should be developed into a minimal viable product, service or a national program. \n\n The ROI is your net profit divided by the cost of that investment. Simply, find your expected revenue from implementing the idea and subtract your expected cost to develop it. Divide this number by the same expected cost to develop your idea.\n\n$$\nROI=\\frac{Profit-Investment_{cost}}{Investment_{cost}}\n$$\n\n To obtain the financial data for this calculation, it is best for an innovation campaign to incorporate some questions that capture the financial implications of the idea and have subject matter experts (SMEs) revise the numbers as the idea evolves. Your open innovation campaign will likely generate a broad range of valuable ideas so thinking about new value creation broadly will be important. \n\n To guide us in calculating ROI, I use Ray Sheen’s and Amy Gall’s [Guide to Building Your Business Case](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Building-Your-Business-Case/dp/1633690024/) published in the Harvard Business Review. It is a concise read with ample financial guidance. Sheen and Gall suggest describing ‘profit’ as ‘benefit’ to assess the positive impact since many ideas will not be easily financially quantifiable at the early stage of your innovation campaign’s funnel. Going forward, we will use ‘Estimated Benefit’, as a substitute for ‘Profit’ and ‘Estimate Cost’, as a substitute for all of the possible costs involved in developing the idea. \n\n *The Estimated Benefit of your idea describes all of the ways that it adds new value to the issue at hand such as new revenue through sales, productivity savings, and intangible benefits such as improved morale or creating a creative culture.\n The Estimated Cost of your idea describes all of the costs associated with developing and implementing your idea. This can include capital expenditures, one time project expenditures and foreseen operating costs. Idea’s affecting external communities will likely incur some costs.* \n\n In an open innovation campaign, we are asking an idea submitter, or team, to give their best estimate for the value and the development costs of their idea. Given this, let’s adjust the formula to describe the estimated, or potential benefit and the estimated cost of developing the idea into a full project or prototype:\n\n$$\nDevelopment_{cost}=\\frac{Project_{benefit}-Project_{cost}}{Project_{cost}}\n$$\n\n## Design your Open Innovation Campaign to Collect Financial Data \n Now let’s review some typical components to your open innovation workflow. To start, your workflow will begin with a call to action, or problem statement, that asks people to submit an idea that details or addresses your innovation intent. The idea may describe a problem really well, alluding to operational costs, that if addressed, could save the company money or an idea submitter may describe a new program that is designed to improve the health of a community.\n\n To be able to do an ROI calculation, you will need to collect information from the idea submitter, or their team, that helps to quantify the estimated benefit and cost of the idea. This means you will need to incorporate sub-questions that ask about the potential benefits and potential costs to develop the idea.\n\n If your idea submitter is not asked to describe the idea’s quantifiable financial, social or environmental impact when the idea is submitted, your team will need to incorporate additional stages within your workflow to gather such ROI quantifiable financial information. Also, not all ideas submissions will describe a benefit in a way that is easily quantifiable so it is important that such sub-questions are made optional to idea submitters so the essence of the idea is still captured. The power of open innovation is that the crowd and its subject matter experts can help think through an idea’s components. Below is how I visualize an open innovation campaign’s stages and where you can ask quantifiable financial questions:\n\n![](Idea-evaluation-process.jpg.webp)\n\n Here are some examples of estimated-benefit and estimated cost questions:\n\n  - *Who is positively impacted by this idea?* This question will tell us if there are front line workers, engineers, sellers, marketers, leadership or community members that can benefit from this idea. This answer can be in the form of new revenue, cost savings or improved morale numbers.  \n  - *If implemented, how much time do you think this idea will save you or others each day?*  In addition to the overall benefit of the idea, this question pushes the idea submitter to think about time saved in doing a particular task or process. \n  - *Can this idea be developed and deployed with existing company technologies, workflows, advantages or will it require a new technology, workflow or staff to manage it?* This question informs the project team if this is something that the organization can manage immediately or will require more time to procure or develop in-house.\n\n These questions ask for parts of the total estimated benefit and costs and are usually easier to answer than asking for a total estimated benefit and cost of an idea. The end goal in calculating an ROI on any idea is to obtain the total Estimated Benefit (i.e. `$1,000,000` saved) and the total Estimated Cost (ie. `$100,000` including development and training). \n\n Should an idea be selected, you will want to repeat this calculation for the actual total benefits and the actual total costs of development and management of the solution a few months or years later. Depending on the type of solution, your team may need to design more complex ROI calculations, such as break even analysis and net present value. Please refer to the HBR Guide to Building Your Business Case for such guidance. \n\n Please [reach out to me](https://ideascale.com/innovation-services/) if you want to discuss how best to engage your crowd about quantifying ROI and impact of their ideas\n\n## An Idea that Saves Time\n To make this topic more tangible, let’s calculate a hypothetical solution’s estimated benefit of saving a company time on a process. Let’s take a hospital’s reception room as an example. Upon arrival a new patient may have to complete several pages of health history paperwork that is usually on a clipboard. Afterwards, a receptionist may be responsible for creating a new user profile in the hospital’s database by manually typing the patient’s paperwork into a digital form. Creating this new user profile can take a total of 30 minutes.\n\n In our open innovation campaign example, an employee heard about a new application that another hospital uses called FastForm which is both a Microsoft and Apple application that syncs with a hospital’s patient database. The employee submits an idea to use the FastForm application for the hospital’s new patient intake, alluding to it’s time savings.\n\n If this employee’s idea were to be implemented, instead of a patient completing the paper form, the patient would complete a digital form taking the same amount of time, about 10 minutes; however, the data will now automatically sync to the computer desktop FastForm application. This creates a shareable patient profile and eliminates the need for the administrator to enter patient data directly into the database which can take up to 20 minutes.\n\n## Quantify an Idea’s Time Savings Into  Financial Benefit\n To calculate the time saved for this idea, let’s assume the idea submitter did not estimate the total benefit or the total cost of implementing their idea. We will need to calculate the cost of performing the current task and what might be the cost of the idea submitters’ new solution.\n\n  - How much time does it take to currently manage the task? \n\n To answer this, you can ask, “Who in the organization is typically responsible for doing such a task?” Let’s say one receptionist is responsible for creating the new profiles each day. The next step is to calculate how many new patient profiles the receptionist enters into the hospital’s system per day. We’ve been told that a receptionist manually enters, on average, 10 new patient profiles a day and it takes about 20 minutes to create each profile manually. That is 200 minutes a day to enter 10 new patient profiles. \n\n  - How much does this task currently cost the organization per year?\n\n Let’s convert our numbers into some financial numbers. The 200 minutes spent daily is 3.33 hours per day entering new profiles. The receptionist’s wage is `$15` per hour so to keep things simple we calculate `$15` wage multiplied by 3.33 hours to arrive at approximately `$50` as the cost of creating and entering a day’s worth of new patient profiles. The receptionist works an average of 261 days per year therefore 261 days multiplied by `$50` a day is a `$13,050` cost per year to create new patient profiles for one hospital. In other words, one receptionist creating on average 2610 new user profiles (261 X 10 profiles per day) costs the hospital `$13,050` a year.\n\n  - What is the estimated benefit of the proposed solution? \n\n To answer this, we must first ask, “what is the new time it will take to manage a task with the proposed solution?” To begin, start organizing all of the numbers that come to mind. The first cost is purchasing a new iPad and the iOS application which is $300 for each receptionist using the new solution.  For simplicity, we will not include software configuration or training costs; however, they are important to note.\n\n Once the iPad and its FastForm application is up and running, a new patient will still take 10 minutes to create a patient profile using the iPad; however, the job of the receptionist to take the paper forms and enter them into the database is eliminated because the software application already syncs the data automatically. 200 minutes are now saved each day and thanks to our earlier calculation, we can present `$13,050` a year of estimated benefit for one receptionist deploying the iPad and application solution. You can decide later how best to incorporate the value and time saved by the customer in the future.  \n\n## ROI Calculation for a Submitted Idea\n The idea involves purchasing 1 new iPad and the iOS application that syncs with the existing desktop software. \n\n$$\nROI_{est}=\\frac{Project_{benefit}-Project_{cost}}{Project_{cost}}\n$$\n\n`$13,050` is saved and is the initial Estimated Benefit. `$300` is the Estimated Cost of purchasing one iPad with the FastForm application.\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\$\\text{13050 }–\\\\,\\$\\text{300}}{\\$\\text{300}}=\\text{425}\\\\%\\\\,\\text{ROI}\n$$\n\n<!-- http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/textmacros.html?highlight=percent -->\n\n We can now adjust these numbers to the full scale of receptionists expected to be impacted, their average (or median) hourly rate and by the quantity of iPads required across the entire hospital. For example, if twenty receptionists start to use the new iPad, we’re looking at `$261,000` of savings per year. That’s over a quarter million dollars!\n\n## Summary\n This is a simple calculation of time and money saved; however, the $13,050 of estimated benefit will need to be considered against other benefits such as what the administrators and patients can be doing with the extra time saved in the waiting room and elsewhere. \n\n An additional consideration may be the hours of training for the receptionists each year or iPad repairs. By now you should see there are multiple ways to calculate a solution’s benefits and costs. \n\n An idea with a positive ROI will need to be compared against other factors and ideas for unknown project management costs, legal risks and business priorities before being selected.\n\n In conclusion, when designing an open innovation challenge, take time to think through how and when to ask about the financial implications of the ideas submitted. The goal is to gather important financial details without stymying your crowd’s ideation. Thinking through how to tease out the financial details of an idea can be a bit of work but will ultimately help you to communicate your innovation campaign’s true financial value and help make the type of innovation decisions that will sustain your organization into the future.\n\n","source":"_posts/work_仕事/Calculating-the-ROI-of-an-Idea.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Calculating the ROI of an Idea\ntags:\n  - Entrepreneur\nsticky: 999\ncomments: true\nlang: en_US\ntoc: true\ntocOpen: true\nindexing: true\nhome_posts_tag: false\ntop: false\ndonate: false\ngeolocation: 'Saitama, Japan'\ncopyright: false\nmathjax: true\nshare: false\ncategories:\n  - Work_仕事\nimg: /2021/0916/Work_仕事/Calculating-the-ROI-of-an-Idea/AdobeStock_189541916.svg\ndate: 2021-09-16 18:14:40\n---\n SOURCE: https://ideascale.com/calculating-the-roi-of-ideas-saved-time/\n By: Rico Oyola\n Published: 2021 September 11\n\n---\n\n {% blockquote %}\n   Crowdsourcing and open innovation initiatives are vital by bringing vast stakeholders together to share ideas on complex problems and opportunities. Much of the focus is set on engaging the crowd yet deciding which ideas to take a risk on requires data on the likely impacts and costs. \n{% endblockquote %}\n\n One of the top innovation management topics I run into is evaluating the Return on Investment (ROI) for an idea. In my practice several clients evaluate their ideas based on quantifiable metrics that help their innovation teams to measure the costs and the real value or impact of their solutions. In this article I will provide an overview on how to calculate an idea’s ROI, focusing on an idea that will save employees’ time doing a task (one of the most common solutions suggested in employee open innovation campaigns). This calculation can be both a simple and a comprehensive process depending on the complexity of the project’s intended solution. What’s important is that calculating ROI for an idea makes sense for your business, your leadership and is a process that can be applied consistently across a variety of promising ideas and innovation decisions.\n\n## Introduction to ROI\n Calculating the ROI can serve as a valuable exercise to understand whether one of your open innovation campaign’s ideas should be developed into a project and whether a project should be developed into a minimal viable product, service or a national program. \n\n The ROI is your net profit divided by the cost of that investment. Simply, find your expected revenue from implementing the idea and subtract your expected cost to develop it. Divide this number by the same expected cost to develop your idea.\n\n$$\nROI=\\frac{Profit-Investment_{cost}}{Investment_{cost}}\n$$\n\n To obtain the financial data for this calculation, it is best for an innovation campaign to incorporate some questions that capture the financial implications of the idea and have subject matter experts (SMEs) revise the numbers as the idea evolves. Your open innovation campaign will likely generate a broad range of valuable ideas so thinking about new value creation broadly will be important. \n\n To guide us in calculating ROI, I use Ray Sheen’s and Amy Gall’s [Guide to Building Your Business Case](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Building-Your-Business-Case/dp/1633690024/) published in the Harvard Business Review. It is a concise read with ample financial guidance. Sheen and Gall suggest describing ‘profit’ as ‘benefit’ to assess the positive impact since many ideas will not be easily financially quantifiable at the early stage of your innovation campaign’s funnel. Going forward, we will use ‘Estimated Benefit’, as a substitute for ‘Profit’ and ‘Estimate Cost’, as a substitute for all of the possible costs involved in developing the idea. \n\n *The Estimated Benefit of your idea describes all of the ways that it adds new value to the issue at hand such as new revenue through sales, productivity savings, and intangible benefits such as improved morale or creating a creative culture.\n The Estimated Cost of your idea describes all of the costs associated with developing and implementing your idea. This can include capital expenditures, one time project expenditures and foreseen operating costs. Idea’s affecting external communities will likely incur some costs.* \n\n In an open innovation campaign, we are asking an idea submitter, or team, to give their best estimate for the value and the development costs of their idea. Given this, let’s adjust the formula to describe the estimated, or potential benefit and the estimated cost of developing the idea into a full project or prototype:\n\n$$\nDevelopment_{cost}=\\frac{Project_{benefit}-Project_{cost}}{Project_{cost}}\n$$\n\n## Design your Open Innovation Campaign to Collect Financial Data \n Now let’s review some typical components to your open innovation workflow. To start, your workflow will begin with a call to action, or problem statement, that asks people to submit an idea that details or addresses your innovation intent. The idea may describe a problem really well, alluding to operational costs, that if addressed, could save the company money or an idea submitter may describe a new program that is designed to improve the health of a community.\n\n To be able to do an ROI calculation, you will need to collect information from the idea submitter, or their team, that helps to quantify the estimated benefit and cost of the idea. This means you will need to incorporate sub-questions that ask about the potential benefits and potential costs to develop the idea.\n\n If your idea submitter is not asked to describe the idea’s quantifiable financial, social or environmental impact when the idea is submitted, your team will need to incorporate additional stages within your workflow to gather such ROI quantifiable financial information. Also, not all ideas submissions will describe a benefit in a way that is easily quantifiable so it is important that such sub-questions are made optional to idea submitters so the essence of the idea is still captured. The power of open innovation is that the crowd and its subject matter experts can help think through an idea’s components. Below is how I visualize an open innovation campaign’s stages and where you can ask quantifiable financial questions:\n\n![](Idea-evaluation-process.jpg.webp)\n\n Here are some examples of estimated-benefit and estimated cost questions:\n\n  - *Who is positively impacted by this idea?* This question will tell us if there are front line workers, engineers, sellers, marketers, leadership or community members that can benefit from this idea. This answer can be in the form of new revenue, cost savings or improved morale numbers.  \n  - *If implemented, how much time do you think this idea will save you or others each day?*  In addition to the overall benefit of the idea, this question pushes the idea submitter to think about time saved in doing a particular task or process. \n  - *Can this idea be developed and deployed with existing company technologies, workflows, advantages or will it require a new technology, workflow or staff to manage it?* This question informs the project team if this is something that the organization can manage immediately or will require more time to procure or develop in-house.\n\n These questions ask for parts of the total estimated benefit and costs and are usually easier to answer than asking for a total estimated benefit and cost of an idea. The end goal in calculating an ROI on any idea is to obtain the total Estimated Benefit (i.e. `$1,000,000` saved) and the total Estimated Cost (ie. `$100,000` including development and training). \n\n Should an idea be selected, you will want to repeat this calculation for the actual total benefits and the actual total costs of development and management of the solution a few months or years later. Depending on the type of solution, your team may need to design more complex ROI calculations, such as break even analysis and net present value. Please refer to the HBR Guide to Building Your Business Case for such guidance. \n\n Please [reach out to me](https://ideascale.com/innovation-services/) if you want to discuss how best to engage your crowd about quantifying ROI and impact of their ideas\n\n## An Idea that Saves Time\n To make this topic more tangible, let’s calculate a hypothetical solution’s estimated benefit of saving a company time on a process. Let’s take a hospital’s reception room as an example. Upon arrival a new patient may have to complete several pages of health history paperwork that is usually on a clipboard. Afterwards, a receptionist may be responsible for creating a new user profile in the hospital’s database by manually typing the patient’s paperwork into a digital form. Creating this new user profile can take a total of 30 minutes.\n\n In our open innovation campaign example, an employee heard about a new application that another hospital uses called FastForm which is both a Microsoft and Apple application that syncs with a hospital’s patient database. The employee submits an idea to use the FastForm application for the hospital’s new patient intake, alluding to it’s time savings.\n\n If this employee’s idea were to be implemented, instead of a patient completing the paper form, the patient would complete a digital form taking the same amount of time, about 10 minutes; however, the data will now automatically sync to the computer desktop FastForm application. This creates a shareable patient profile and eliminates the need for the administrator to enter patient data directly into the database which can take up to 20 minutes.\n\n## Quantify an Idea’s Time Savings Into  Financial Benefit\n To calculate the time saved for this idea, let’s assume the idea submitter did not estimate the total benefit or the total cost of implementing their idea. We will need to calculate the cost of performing the current task and what might be the cost of the idea submitters’ new solution.\n\n  - How much time does it take to currently manage the task? \n\n To answer this, you can ask, “Who in the organization is typically responsible for doing such a task?” Let’s say one receptionist is responsible for creating the new profiles each day.

Much of the focus is set on engaging the crowd yet deciding which ideas to take a risk on requires data on the likely impacts and costs. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p> One of the top innovation management topics I run into is evaluating the Return on Investment (ROI) for an idea. In my practice several clients evaluate their ideas based on quantifiable metrics that help their innovation teams to measure the costs and the real value or impact of their solutions. In this article I will provide an overview on how to calculate an idea’s ROI, focusing on an idea that will save employees’ time doing a task (one of the most common solutions suggested in employee open innovation campaigns). This calculation can be both a simple and a comprehensive process depending on the complexity of the project’s intended solution. What’s important is that calculating ROI for an idea makes sense for your business, your leadership and is a process that can be applied consistently across a variety of promising ideas and innovation decisions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Introduction-to-ROI\"><a href=\"#Introduction-to-ROI\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Introduction to ROI\"></a>Introduction to ROI</h2><p> Calculating the ROI can serve as a valuable exercise to understand whether one of your open innovation campaign’s ideas should be developed into a project and whether a project should be developed into a minimal viable product, service or a national program. </p>\n<p> The ROI is your net profit divided by the cost of that investment. Simply, find your expected revenue from implementing the idea and subtract your expected cost to develop it. Divide this number by the same expected cost to develop your idea.</p>\n<p>$$<br>ROI&#x3D;\\frac{Profit-Investment_{cost}}{Investment_{cost}}<br>$$</p>\n<p> To obtain the financial data for this calculation, it is best for an innovation campaign to incorporate some questions that capture the financial implications of the idea and have subject matter experts (SMEs) revise the numbers as the idea evolves. Your open innovation campaign will likely generate a broad range of valuable ideas so thinking about new value creation broadly will be important. </p>\n<p> To guide us in calculating ROI, I use Ray Sheen’s and Amy Gall’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Building-Your-Business-Case/dp/1633690024/\">Guide to Building Your Business Case</a> published in the Harvard Business Review. It is a concise read with ample financial guidance. Sheen and Gall suggest describing ‘profit’ as ‘benefit’ to assess the positive impact since many ideas will not be easily financially quantifiable at the early stage of your innovation campaign’s funnel. Going forward, we will use ‘Estimated Benefit’, as a substitute for ‘Profit’ and ‘Estimate Cost’, as a substitute for all of the possible costs involved in developing the idea. </p>\n<p> <em>The Estimated Benefit of your idea describes all of the ways that it adds new value to the issue at hand such as new revenue through sales, productivity savings, and intangible benefits such as improved morale or creating a creative culture.<br> The Estimated Cost of your idea describes all of the costs associated with developing and implementing your idea. This can include capital expenditures, one time project expenditures and foreseen operating costs. Idea’s affecting external communities will likely incur some costs.</em> </p>\n<p> In an open innovation campaign, we are asking an idea submitter, or team, to give their best estimate for the value and the development costs of their idea. Given this, let’s adjust the formula to describe the estimated, or potential benefit and the estimated cost of developing the idea into a full project or prototype:</p>\n<p>$$<br>Development_{cost}&#x3D;\\frac{Project_{benefit}-Project_{cost}}{Project_{cost}}<br>$$</p>\n<h2 id=\"Design-your-Open-Innovation-Campaign-to-Collect-Financial-Data\"><a href=\"#Design-your-Open-Innovation-Campaign-to-Collect-Financial-Data\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Design your Open Innovation Campaign to Collect Financial Data\"></a>Design your Open Innovation Campaign to Collect Financial Data</h2><p> Now let’s review some typical components to your open innovation workflow. To start, your workflow will begin with a call to action, or problem statement, that asks people to submit an idea that details or addresses your innovation intent. The idea may describe a problem really well, alluding to operational costs, that if addressed, could save the company money or an idea submitter may describe a new program that is designed to improve the health of a community.</p>\n<p> To be able to do an ROI calculation, you will need to collect information from the idea submitter, or their team, that helps to quantify the estimated benefit and cost of the idea. This means you will need to incorporate sub-questions that ask about the potential benefits and potential costs to develop the idea.</p>\n<p> If your idea submitter is not asked to describe the idea’s quantifiable financial, social or environmental impact when the idea is submitted, your team will need to incorporate additional stages within your workflow to gather such ROI quantifiable financial information. Also, not all ideas submissions will describe a benefit in a way that is easily quantifiable so it is important that such sub-questions are made optional to idea submitters so the essence of the idea is still captured. The power of open innovation is that the crowd and its subject matter experts can help think through an idea’s components. Below is how I visualize an open innovation campaign’s stages and where you can ask quantifiable financial questions:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/Idea-evaluation-process.jpg.webp\"></p>\n<p> Here are some examples of estimated-benefit and estimated cost questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Who is positively impacted by this idea?</em> This question will tell us if there are front line workers, engineers, sellers, marketers, leadership or community members that can benefit from this idea. This answer can be in the form of new revenue, cost savings or improved morale numbers.  </li>\n<li><em>If implemented, how much time do you think this idea will save you or others each day?</em>  In addition to the overall benefit of the idea, this question pushes the idea submitter to think about time saved in doing a particular task or process. </li>\n<li><em>Can this idea be developed and deployed with existing company technologies, workflows, advantages or will it require a new technology, workflow or staff to manage it?</em> This question informs the project team if this is something that the organization can manage immediately or will require more time to procure or develop in-house.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> These questions ask for parts of the total estimated benefit and costs and are usually easier to answer than asking for a total estimated benefit and cost of an idea. The end goal in calculating an ROI on any idea is to obtain the total Estimated Benefit (i.e. <code>$1,000,000</code> saved) and the total Estimated Cost (ie. <code>$100,000</code> including development and training). </p>\n<p> Should an idea be selected, you will want to repeat this calculation for the actual total benefits and the actual total costs of development and management of the solution a few months or years later. Depending on the type of solution, your team may need to design more complex ROI calculations, such as break even analysis and net present value. Please refer to the HBR Guide to Building Your Business Case for such guidance. </p>\n<p> Please <a href=\"https://ideascale.com/innovation-services/\">reach out to me</a> if you want to discuss how best to engage your crowd about quantifying ROI and impact of their ideas</p>\n<h2 id=\"An-Idea-that-Saves-Time\"><a href=\"#An-Idea-that-Saves-Time\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"An Idea that Saves Time\"></a>An Idea that Saves Time</h2><p> To make this topic more tangible, let’s calculate a hypothetical solution’s estimated benefit of saving a company time on a process. Let’s take a hospital’s reception room as an example. Upon arrival a new patient may have to complete several pages of health history paperwork that is usually on a clipboard. Afterwards, a receptionist may be responsible for creating a new user profile in the hospital’s database by manually typing the patient’s paperwork into a digital form. Creating this new user profile can take a total of 30 minutes.</p>\n<p> In our open innovation campaign example, an employee heard about a new application that another hospital uses called FastForm which is both a Microsoft and Apple application that syncs with a hospital’s patient database. The employee submits an idea to use the FastForm application for the hospital’s new patient intake, alluding to it’s time savings.</p>\n<p> If this employee’s idea were to be implemented, instead of a patient completing the paper form, the patient would complete a digital form taking the same amount of time, about 10 minutes; however, the data will now automatically sync to the computer desktop FastForm application. This creates a shareable patient profile and eliminates the need for the administrator to enter patient data directly into the database which can take up to 20 minutes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Quantify-an-Idea’s-Time-Savings-Into-Financial-Benefit\"><a href=\"#Quantify-an-Idea’s-Time-Savings-Into-Financial-Benefit\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Quantify an Idea’s Time Savings Into  Financial Benefit\"></a>Quantify an Idea’s Time Savings Into  Financial Benefit</h2><p> To calculate the time saved for this idea, let’s assume the idea submitter did not estimate the total benefit or the total cost of implementing their idea. We will need to calculate the cost of performing the current task and what might be the cost of the idea submitters’ new solution.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much time does it take to currently manage the task?</li>\n</ul>\n<p> To answer this, you can ask, “Who in the organization is typically responsible for doing such a task?” Let’s say one receptionist is responsible for creating the new profiles each day. The next step is to calculate how many new patient profiles the receptionist enters into the hospital’s system per day. We’ve been told that a receptionist manually enters, on average, 10 new patient profiles a day and it takes about 20 minutes to create each profile manually. That is 200 minutes a day to enter 10 new patient profiles. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much does this task currently cost the organization per year?</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Let’s convert our numbers into some financial numbers. The 200 minutes spent daily is 3.33 hours per day entering new profiles. The receptionist’s wage is <code>$15</code> per hour so to keep things simple we calculate <code>$15</code> wage multiplied by 3.33 hours to arrive at approximately <code>$50</code> as the cost of creating and entering a day’s worth of new patient profiles. The receptionist works an average of 261 days per year therefore 261 days multiplied by <code>$50</code> a day is a <code>$13,050</code> cost per year to create new patient profiles for one hospital. In other words, one receptionist creating on average 2610 new user profiles (261 X 10 profiles per day) costs the hospital <code>$13,050</code> a year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the estimated benefit of the proposed solution?</li>\n</ul>\n<p> To answer this, we must first ask, “what is the new time it will take to manage a task with the proposed solution?” To begin, start organizing all of the numbers that come to mind. The first cost is purchasing a new iPad and the iOS application which is $300 for each receptionist using the new solution.  For simplicity, we will not include software configuration or training costs; however, they are important to note.</p>\n<p> Once the iPad and its FastForm application is up and running, a new patient will still take 10 minutes to create a patient profile using the iPad; however, the job of the receptionist to take the paper forms and enter them into the database is eliminated because the software application already syncs the data automatically. 200 minutes are now saved each day and thanks to our earlier calculation, we can present <code>$13,050</code> a year of estimated benefit for one receptionist deploying the iPad and application solution. You can decide later how best to incorporate the value and time saved by the customer in the future.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"ROI-Calculation-for-a-Submitted-Idea\"><a href=\"#ROI-Calculation-for-a-Submitted-Idea\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"ROI Calculation for a Submitted Idea\"></a>ROI Calculation for a Submitted Idea</h2><p> The idea involves purchasing 1 new iPad and the iOS application that syncs with the existing desktop software. </p>\n<p>$$<br>ROI_{est}&#x3D;\\frac{Project_{benefit}-Project_{cost}}{Project_{cost}}<br>$$</p>\n<p><code>$13,050</code> is saved and is the initial Estimated Benefit. <code>$300</code> is the Estimated Cost of purchasing one iPad with the FastForm application.</p>\n<p>$$<br>\\frac{$\\text{13050 }–\\,$\\text{300}}{$\\text{300}}&#x3D;\\text{425}\\%\\,\\text{ROI}<br>$$</p>\n<!-- http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/textmacros.html?highlight=percent -->\n\n<p> We can now adjust these numbers to the full scale of receptionists expected to be impacted, their average (or median) hourly rate and by the quantity of iPads required across the entire hospital. For example, if twenty receptionists start to use the new iPad, we’re looking at <code>$261,000</code> of savings per year. That’s over a quarter million dollars!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Summary\"><a href=\"#Summary\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Summary\"></a>Summary</h2><p> This is a simple calculation of time and money saved; however, the $13,050 of estimated benefit will need to be considered against other benefits such as what the administrators and patients can be doing with the extra time saved in the waiting room and elsewhere. </p>\n<p> An additional consideration may be the hours of training for the receptionists each year or iPad repairs. By now you should see there are multiple ways to calculate a solution’s benefits and costs. </p>\n<p> An idea with a positive ROI will need to be compared against other factors and ideas for unknown project management costs, legal risks and business priorities before being selected.</p>\n<p> In conclusion, when designing an open innovation challenge, take time to think through how and when to ask about the financial implications of the ideas submitted. The goal is to gather important financial details without stymying your crowd’s ideation. Thinking through how to tease out the financial details of an idea can be a bit of work but will ultimately help you to communicate your innovation campaign’s true financial value and help make the type of innovation decisions that will sustain your organization into the future.</p>\n"},{"title":"New Blog","top":false,"description":"New blog site!

I often find myself wanting better control over how my content is shared and displayed. Being too lazy to house it myself, I relied on FaceBook to keep my journal entries. Now, I will export my data from those sites and compile them here. </p>\n<p> This software is based on <a href=\"https://hexo.io/\">HEXO</a> that runs on NodeJS. 👨🏻‍💻 It’s an open-source development software that converts <a href=\"https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/\">Markdown</a> files into a full HTML static website. Biggest downside to this solution is that I need to run the command-line tool on my MacBookPro to regenerate the pages. Then commit to GitHub. You can’t simply add a quick post directly to the site. I can still directly add new posts in Github, but it won’t be reflected on the site until I regenerate the code from my home laptop.</p>\n<p> The biggest advantage is that I have full control over the layout and design of the site. And, because there is no input function, it’s very difficult to hack the site. 🔒 Plus, as there is no preprocessing of data on the backend, the site is blazingly fast!💨 Additionally, markdown files are a <em>lot</em> easier to read without the encapsulating code.  These positives outweigh the negatives by a kiloton in my book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"SNS-Social-Networking-service-support\"><a href=\"#SNS-Social-Networking-service-support\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SNS (Social Networking service) support\"></a>SNS (Social Networking service) support</h2><p> 🌏 I will continue to use those social media platforms.

I’ve never met a self-made millionaire that worked as a “slave” for another employer. I’ve met smartPhone game developers that hit it big simply because their game went “viral.” Often they either continue adding content or sell the rights of the game to a big distributor. There are several avenues one could take to earn active and passive income streams. The most successful are those that figured out how to make more passive income than active income. As the name implies, passive income, requires no active work to continue revenue. These are the ideas that I want to work on more. Like those game developers, I need something that goes “viral” and enables me to input minimum work after slaving over the initial time-investment of building the system. </p>\n<h2 id=\"Ideas-for-streams\"><a href=\"#Ideas-for-streams\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ideas for streams\"></a>Ideas for streams</h2><p> Below are some of the ideas that interest me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build an idea sharing site where you can publish your work on the blockchain (similar to the USPTO)</li>\n<li>Blockchain ideas and money management</li>\n<li>Continue investments in Proof-of-Stake blockchains where I earn coins by simply staking my coins on the network.</li>\n<li>Microgreens and Vertical farming</li>\n<li>LEGO Academy (where I could teach kids about colors, engineering, and architecture through LEGO bricks)</li>\n<li>LEGO store (sell LEGO sets and parts online)</li>\n<li>Software development</li>\n<li>Build a network of EV charging stations in Hokkaido</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"title":"Six Things to Keep in Mind Before You Launch","sticky":999,"comments":1,"lang":"en_US","toc":false,"tocOpen":true,"indexing":true,"home_posts_tag":false,"top":false,"donate":false,"geolocation":"Saitama, Japan","copyright":false,"mathjax":false,"share":false,"img":"/2013/0501/Work_仕事/Six-things-to-keep-in-mind-before-you-launch/1520217277898.jpeg","date":"2013-05-01T03:59:00.000Z","_content":" SOURCE: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130429212318-24171-six-things-to-keep-in-mind-before-you-launch\n By: Jason Calacanis\n Published: 2013 April 29\n\n ---\n\n# Six things to keep in mind before you launch\n \nMany of you know I’m working on my new startup Inside.com.\n\nI’m pre-launch and loving it!\n\nYou can follow the project: https://angel.co/inside and http://www.twitter.com/inside.

They were all blown away, with all but one asking to invest on the spot. Awesome.\n\nFeels like I’ve got a winner on my hands -- which is a great feeling. You know when you have the stone cold nuts in poker and you just can’t wait to flip your cards and show the rest of the world? Yep, that’s where I’m at right now. If you don’t play poker, just imagine that you’ve fought really hard to win and there is a big pile of chips in front of you and they’re all yours -- you simply need to show your cards.\n\nStone. Cold. Nuts. Baby!\n\nThis is one of my favorite moments of a startup, and there are six rules I have for when you are pre-launch that I thought I would share:\n\n1. **Sell the promise**: There are two ideal times to raise money for a startup: before your launch and when you start your hockey stick growth curve. Before you launch you’re selling the promise of your vision--which is unquantified. This is a great thing for the founder because the investor doesn’t have any metrics to put on the product. After you launch? Oh no, they might study the stats and think “this is not trending well.” That being said, I’m not raising money.\n\n2. **Tell people you’re *not* raising money**: When you ask for money you get advice, so go out and ask for advice and you’ll get money. I’ve been holding the line that I’m not raising money, but let’s be honest: we’re all raising money if it’s the right person who adds massive value.\n\n3. **Get tons of advice and write it down**: I’ve been taking a ton of notes during and after meetings with smart folks. I ask them very short questions and record the answers: ‘what do you think?,’ ‘what your favorite part?,’ ‘what’s your least favorite part?,’ ‘would you use it? how?,’ and ‘who do you think would have awesome feedback on this?’ That last part is great, because then you can get a warm intro to that person. “Oh, you think Michael Moritz would dig this? Perhaps you can intro me?’ Boom! This advice is going to come in handy down the road.\n\n4. **Double blind your design**: The world is design driven right now. The best products are the ones that look the best AND that solve a big problem. So, if you’re going to launch I suggest doing a double-blind design. Give two freelance designers your product spec and have them show you two different worldviews based on it. I’ve done the first and I’m actually studying dribbble.com and behance.net looking for a second set of mocks. This will cost $2k to $10k but is well worth it.\n\n5. **Take your time**: We’re giving ourselves a ton of time to test and get the product right. We’re not doing the public lean startup MVP thing. Nope, we know we have a killer product and we’re doing all kinds of hidden, private MVP things (like buying Facebook traffic in a Midwest city and sending 1,000 folks to a hidden page). We want it to be perfect. It won’t be, but we want it to be so we’re going to give ourselves a lot of extra time.\n\n6. **Plan for a big launch**: You get one launch so you want to take your time and you want to launch right. Right now I'm collecting a ton of emails and Twitter followers and NOT talking to any press. As we get closer to launch, I’ll start giving little clues and then asking you to join an exclusive beta. For best practices on this process, study what MailBox App did with their reservation system ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailbox_(app) ) or check out LaunchRock.\n\nAnyway, that’s all I got on pre-launch.\n\nOh wait, one more thing ... I need a favor!!!\n\nIn order to get it done, I need to add three people to our team. I hope you’ll help me by forwarding this around:\n\n1. Lead developer / VP of Engineering: Someone who can lead a team of six awesome developers and designers. You’ve built a large, scalable project before and you lead by example. You code yourself and you keep yourself up to date on all the latest technologies. You’re indefatigable and you want to win. We are a python/django shop.\n\n2. Front-end developer: You wants to break new ground in UX and have a product that’s used everyday by everyone (which is what we’re building!). You’re someone who appreciates what Qz.com, Flipboard, Circa and Medium.com are doing with their interfaces. You’re lightning fast and you have an opinion about what makes a great product.\n\n3. Versatile developer: You can get frontend and backend work done, and you’re an unstoppable machine when it comes to ripping through the roadmap. You like to be judged by your work.\n\n4. Acqui-hiring: I’d also consider acqui-hiring a team of developers in Los Angeles if you know one.\n\nIf you’re any of these folks, ping me... I want you on the team. jason@inside.com\n\nIf I wind up hiring someone you forward to me, I’ll give you a “pass for life” to my LAUNCH Festival, sushi in a major city or a Knicks game (and I get good seats typically, since I got the hook up!).\n\n:-)\n\nall the best, [@jason](http://www.twitter.com/jason)","source":"_posts/work_仕事/Six-things-to-keep-in-mind-before-you-launch.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Six things to keep in mind before you launch\ntags:\n  - migrated from FaceBook\n  - Entrepreneur\nsticky: 999\ncomments: true\nlang: en_US\ntoc: false\ntocOpen: true\nindexing: true\nhome_posts_tag: false\ntop: false\ndonate: false\ngeolocation: 'Saitama, Japan'\ncopyright: false\nmathjax: false\nshare: false\nimg: >-\n  /2013/0501/Work_仕事/Six-things-to-keep-in-mind-before-you-launch/1520217277898.jpeg\ncategories:\n  - Work_仕事\ndate: 2013-05-01 12:59:00\n---\n SOURCE: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130429212318-24171-six-things-to-keep-in-mind-before-you-launch\n By: Jason Calacanis\n Published: 2013 April 29\n\n ---\n\n# Six things to keep in mind before you launch\n \nMany of you know I’m working on my new startup Inside.com.\n\nI’m pre-launch and loving it!\n\nYou can follow the project: https://angel.co/inside and http://www.twitter.com/inside.

If you don’t play poker, just imagine that you’ve fought really hard to win and there is a big pile of chips in front of you and they’re all yours – you simply need to show your cards.</p>\n<p>Stone. Cold. Nuts. Baby!</p>\n<p>This is one of my favorite moments of a startup, and there are six rules I have for when you are pre-launch that I thought I would share:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Sell the promise</strong>: There are two ideal times to raise money for a startup: before your launch and when you start your hockey stick growth curve. Before you launch you’re selling the promise of your vision–which is unquantified. This is a great thing for the founder because the investor doesn’t have any metrics to put on the product. After you launch? Oh no, they might study the stats and think “this is not trending well.” That being said, I’m not raising money.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Tell people you’re <em>not</em> raising money</strong>: When you ask for money you get advice, so go out and ask for advice and you’ll get money. I’ve been holding the line that I’m not raising money, but let’s be honest: we’re all raising money if it’s the right person who adds massive value.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Get tons of advice and write it down</strong>: I’ve been taking a ton of notes during and after meetings with smart folks. I ask them very short questions and record the answers: ‘what do you think?,’ ‘what your favorite part?,’ ‘what’s your least favorite part?,’ ‘would you use it? how?,’ and ‘who do you think would have awesome feedback on this?’ That last part is great, because then you can get a warm intro to that person. “Oh, you think Michael Moritz would dig this? Perhaps you can intro me?’ Boom! This advice is going to come in handy down the road.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Double blind your design</strong>: The world is design driven right now. The best products are the ones that look the best AND that solve a big problem. So, if you’re going to launch I suggest doing a double-blind design. Give two freelance designers your product spec and have them show you two different worldviews based on it. I’ve done the first and I’m actually studying dribbble.com and behance.net looking for a second set of mocks. This will cost $2k to $10k but is well worth it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Take your time</strong>: We’re giving ourselves a ton of time to test and get the product right. We’re not doing the public lean startup MVP thing. Nope, we know we have a killer product and we’re doing all kinds of hidden, private MVP things (like buying Facebook traffic in a Midwest city and sending 1,000 folks to a hidden page). We want it to be perfect. It won’t be, but we want it to be so we’re going to give ourselves a lot of extra time.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Plan for a big launch</strong>: You get one launch so you want to take your time and you want to launch right. Right now I’m collecting a ton of emails and Twitter followers and NOT talking to any press. As we get closer to launch, I’ll start giving little clues and then asking you to join an exclusive beta. For best practices on this process, study what MailBox App did with their reservation system ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailbox_(app)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailbox_(app)</a> ) or check out LaunchRock.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Anyway, that’s all I got on pre-launch.</p>\n<p>Oh wait, one more thing … I need a favor!!!</p>\n<p>In order to get it done, I need to add three people to our team. I hope you’ll help me by forwarding this around:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Lead developer &#x2F; VP of Engineering: Someone who can lead a team of six awesome developers and designers. You’ve built a large, scalable project before and you lead by example. You code yourself and you keep yourself up to date on all the latest technologies. You’re indefatigable and you want to win. We are a python&#x2F;django shop.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Front-end developer: You wants to break new ground in UX and have a product that’s used everyday by everyone (which is what we’re building!). You’re someone who appreciates what Qz.com, Flipboard, Circa and Medium.com are doing with their interfaces. You’re lightning fast and you have an opinion about what makes a great product.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Versatile developer: You can get frontend and backend work done, and you’re an unstoppable machine when it comes to ripping through the roadmap. You like to be judged by your work.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Acqui-hiring: I’d also consider acqui-hiring a team of developers in Los Angeles if you know one.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you’re any of these folks, ping me… I want you on the team. <a href=\"mailto:&#106;&#97;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#x69;&#110;&#x73;&#x69;&#100;&#101;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;\">&#106;&#97;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#x69;&#110;&#x73;&#x69;&#100;&#101;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;</a></p>\n<p>If I wind up hiring someone you forward to me, I’ll give you a “pass for life” to my LAUNCH Festival, sushi in a major city or a Knicks game (and I get good seats typically, since I got the hook up!).</p>\n<p>:-)</p>\n<p>all the best, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jason\">@jason</a></p>\n"},{"title":"Tech Industry’s Darkest Secret","sticky":999,"comments":1,"lang":"en_US","toc":false,"tocOpen":true,"indexing":true,"home_posts_tag":false,"top":false,"donate":false,"geolocation":"Saitama, Japan","copyright":false,"mathjax":false,"share":false,"date":"2013-04-26T07:16:00.000Z","_content":" SOURCE: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130422020049-8451-the-tech-industry-s-darkest-secret-it-s-all-about-age\n By: Vivek Wadhwa\n Published: 2013 April 22\n\n ---\n\n# The Tech Industry’s Darkest Secret: It’s All About Age\n\n ![Tech Industry loves youth](born_to_compute.jpeg)\n\n They don’t prepare you for this in college or admit it in job interviews. The harsh reality is that if you are middle-aged, write computer code for a living, and earn a six-figure salary, you’re headed for the unemployment lines. Your market value declines as you age and it becomes harder and harder to get a job.\n\n I know this post will provoke anger, outrage, and denial. But, sadly, this is the way things are in the tech world. It’s an “up or out” profession — like the military. And it’s as competitive as professional sports. Engineers need to be prepared.\n\n This is not openly discussed, because employers could be accused of age discrimination. But research, such as that completed by University of California, Berkeley, professors Clair Brown and Greg Linden shows that even those with masters degrees and Ph.Ds have reason to worry.\n\n Brown and Linden’s analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census data for the semiconductor industry revealed that although salaries increased dramatically for engineers in their 30s, these increases slowed after the age of 40. After 50, the mean salary fell by 17% for those with bachelors degrees and by 14% for those with masters degrees and Ph.Ds. And salary increases for holders of postgraduate degrees were always lower than for those with bachelor’s degrees (in other words, even Ph.D degrees didn’t provide long-term job protection).\n\n It’s the same in the software industry. Prominent Silicon Valley investors often talk about youth being an advantage in entrepreneurship. If you look at their investment portfolios, all you see are engineers who are hardly old enough to shave. They rarely invest in people who are old.\n\n It may be wrong, but look at this from the point of view of the employer. Why would any company pay a computer programmer with out-of-date skills a salary of say $150,000, when it can hire a fresh graduate — who has no skills — for around $60,000? Even if it spends a month training the younger worker, the company is still far ahead. The young understand new technologies better than the old do, and are like a clean slate: They will rapidly learn the latest coding methods and techniques, and they don’t carry any “technology baggage.” The older worker likely has a family and needs to leave the office by 6 p.m. The young can easily pull all-nighters.\n\n What the tech industry often forgets is that with age comes wisdom. Older workers are usually better at following direction, mentoring, and leading. They tend to be more pragmatic and loyal, and to know the importance of being team players. And ego and arrogance usually fade with age.\n\n During my tech days, I hired several programmers who were over 50. They were the steadiest performers and stayed with me through the most difficult times.\n\n It can be difficult for some companies to justify paying the age premium. For tech startups in particular, it always boils down to cost: Most can’t even afford to pay $60,000 salaries, so they look for motivated, young software developers who will accept minimum wage in return for equity ownership and the opportunity to build their careers.\n\n We can blame the employer, but in a free economy you can’t really force any company to hire workers who have the wrong skills or to pay higher salaries. Larger companies develop products for global markets and have global workforces. They will hire where they can get the best skill for the best price.\n\n So, whether we like it or not, it’s a tough industry, and the onus is on employees to keep themselves marketable. I know that many people will take offense at what I have to say, but here is my advice to those whose hair is beginning to grey.\n\n - Move up the ladder into management, architecture, or design, and diversify your experience. Work with business executives in your company, in areas such as sales, finance, marketing/product management, legal, and operations. Develop a broader set of skills that make you more valuable to your employer and that differentiate you from others with just coding skills.\n - Become an entrepreneur. Despite what some investors say, older age is an advantage in the startup world. You know more about industries and markets, and have ideas for products that the world actually needs and a better ability to motivate and manage than a kid out of school does.\n - Keep your skills current. This means keeping up to date with the latest trends in computing, programming techniques, and languages, and adapting to change. To be writing code for a living when you’re 50, you will need to be a rock-star developer and be able to out-code the new kids on the block. Top developers are always in demand and companies will readily pay top dollars for them.\n - If you’re going to stay in programming, realize that the deck is stacked against you. Even though you may be highly experienced and wise, employers aren’t willing or able to pay an experienced worker twice or thrice what an entry-level worker earns. Save as much as you can when you’re in your 30s and 40s, and be prepared to earn less as you gain experience.\n\n Finally, I don’t know of any university, including the ones I teach at, that tells its engineering students what to expect in the long term or how to manage their technical careers. Perhaps it is time to let students know what lies ahead and prepare them for their difficult careers.\n\n","source":"_posts/work_仕事/Tech-Industry’s-Darkest-Secret.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Tech Industry’s Darkest Secret\ntags:\n  - migrated from FaceBook\nsticky: 999\ncomments: true\nlang: en_US\ntoc: false\ntocOpen: true\nindexing: true\nhome_posts_tag: false\ntop: false\ndonate: false\ngeolocation: 'Saitama, Japan'\ncopyright: false\nmathjax: false\nshare: false\ncategories:\n  - Work_仕事\ndate: 2013-04-26 16:16:00\n---\n SOURCE: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130422020049-8451-the-tech-industry-s-darkest-secret-it-s-all-about-age\n By: Vivek Wadhwa\n Published: 2013 April 22\n\n ---\n\n# The Tech Industry’s Darkest Secret: It’s All About Age\n\n ![Tech Industry loves youth](born_to_compute.jpeg)\n\n They don’t prepare you for this in college or admit it in job interviews.

But, sadly, this is the way things are in the tech world. It’s an “up or out” profession — like the military. And it’s as competitive as professional sports. Engineers need to be prepared.</p>\n<p> This is not openly discussed, because employers could be accused of age discrimination. But research, such as that completed by University of California, Berkeley, professors Clair Brown and Greg Linden shows that even those with masters degrees and Ph.Ds have reason to worry.</p>\n<p> Brown and Linden’s analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census data for the semiconductor industry revealed that although salaries increased dramatically for engineers in their 30s, these increases slowed after the age of 40. After 50, the mean salary fell by 17% for those with bachelors degrees and by 14% for those with masters degrees and Ph.Ds. And salary increases for holders of postgraduate degrees were always lower than for those with bachelor’s degrees (in other words, even Ph.D degrees didn’t provide long-term job protection).</p>\n<p> It’s the same in the software industry. Prominent Silicon Valley investors often talk about youth being an advantage in entrepreneurship. If you look at their investment portfolios, all you see are engineers who are hardly old enough to shave. They rarely invest in people who are old.</p>\n<p> It may be wrong, but look at this from the point of view of the employer. Why would any company pay a computer programmer with out-of-date skills a salary of say $150,000, when it can hire a fresh graduate — who has no skills — for around $60,000? Even if it spends a month training the younger worker, the company is still far ahead. The young understand new technologies better than the old do, and are like a clean slate: They will rapidly learn the latest coding methods and techniques, and they don’t carry any “technology baggage.” The older worker likely has a family and needs to leave the office by 6 p.m. The young can easily pull all-nighters.</p>\n<p> What the tech industry often forgets is that with age comes wisdom. Older workers are usually better at following direction, mentoring, and leading. They tend to be more pragmatic and loyal, and to know the importance of being team players. And ego and arrogance usually fade with age.</p>\n<p> During my tech days, I hired several programmers who were over 50. They were the steadiest performers and stayed with me through the most difficult times.</p>\n<p> It can be difficult for some companies to justify paying the age premium. For tech startups in particular, it always boils down to cost: Most can’t even afford to pay $60,000 salaries, so they look for motivated, young software developers who will accept minimum wage in return for equity ownership and the opportunity to build their careers.</p>\n<p> We can blame the employer, but in a free economy you can’t really force any company to hire workers who have the wrong skills or to pay higher salaries. Larger companies develop products for global markets and have global workforces. They will hire where they can get the best skill for the best price.</p>\n<p> So, whether we like it or not, it’s a tough industry, and the onus is on employees to keep themselves marketable. I know that many people will take offense at what I have to say, but here is my advice to those whose hair is beginning to grey.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Move up the ladder into management, architecture, or design, and diversify your experience. Work with business executives in your company, in areas such as sales, finance, marketing&#x2F;product management, legal, and operations. Develop a broader set of skills that make you more valuable to your employer and that differentiate you from others with just coding skills.</li>\n<li>Become an entrepreneur. Despite what some investors say, older age is an advantage in the startup world. You know more about industries and markets, and have ideas for products that the world actually needs and a better ability to motivate and manage than a kid out of school does.</li>\n<li>Keep your skills current. This means keeping up to date with the latest trends in computing, programming techniques, and languages, and adapting to change. To be writing code for a living when you’re 50, you will need to be a rock-star developer and be able to out-code the new kids on the block. Top developers are always in demand and companies will readily pay top dollars for them.</li>\n<li>If you’re going to stay in programming, realize that the deck is stacked against you. Even though you may be highly experienced and wise, employers aren’t willing or able to pay an experienced worker twice or thrice what an entry-level worker earns. Save as much as you can when you’re in your 30s and 40s, and be prepared to earn less as you gain experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Finally, I don’t know of any university, including the ones I teach at, that tells its engineering students what to expect in the long term or how to manage their technical careers. Perhaps it is time to let students know what lies ahead and prepare them for their difficult careers.</p>\n"},{"title":"The 'Magic' of Doing One Thing at a Time","sticky":999,"comments":1,"lang":"en_US","toc":false,"tocOpen":true,"indexing":true,"home_posts_tag":false,"top":false,"donate":false,"geolocation":"Saitama, Japan","copyright":true,"mathjax":false,"share":false,"date":"2012-03-28T20:44:00.000Z","_content":"# The Magic of Doing One Thing at a Time\nby Tony Schwartz\nMarch 14, 2012\nSOURCE: https://hbr.org/2012/03/the-magic-of-doing-one-thing-a.html\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is it that between 25% and 50% of people report feeling overwhelmed or burned out at work?\n\nIt’s not just the number of hours we’re working, but also the fact that we spend too many continuous hours juggling too many things at the same time.\n\nWhat we’ve lost, above all, are stopping points, finish lines and boundaries. Technology has blurred them beyond recognition. Wherever we go, our work follows us, on our digital devices, ever insistent and intrusive. It’s like an itch we can’t resist scratching, even though scratching invariably makes it worse.\n\nTell the truth: Do you answer email during conference calls (and sometimes even during calls with one other person)? Do you bring your laptop to meetings and then pretend you’re taking notes while you surf the net? Do you eat lunch at your desk? Do you make calls while you’re driving, and even send the occasional text, even though you know you shouldn’t?\n\nThe biggest cost — assuming you don’t crash — is to your productivity. In part, that’s a simple consequence of splitting your attention, so that you’re partially engaged in multiple activities but rarely fully engaged in any one. In part, it’s because when you switch away from a primary task to do something else, you’re increasing the time it takes to finish that task by an average of 25 per cent.\n\nBut most insidiously, it’s because if you’re always doing something, you’re relentlessly burning down your available reservoir of energy over the course of every day, so you have less available with every passing hour.\n\nI know this from my own experience. I get two to three times as much writing accomplished when I focus without interruption for a designated period of time and then take a real break, away from my desk. The best way for an organization to fuel higher productivity and more innovative thinking is to strongly encourage finite periods of absorbed focus, as well as shorter periods of real renewal.\n\nIf you’re a manager, here are three policies worth promoting:\n\n1. Maintain meeting discipline. Schedule meetings for 45 minutes, rather than an hour or longer, so participants can stay focused, take time afterward to reflect on what’s been discussed, and recover before the next obligation. Start all meetings at a precise time, end at a precise time, and insist that all digital devices be turned off throughout the meeting.\n\n2. Stop demanding or expecting instant responsiveness at every moment of the day. It forces your people into reactive mode, fractures their attention, and makes it difficult for them to sustain attention on their priorities. Let them turn off their email at certain times. If it’s urgent, you can call them — but that won’t happen very often.\n\n3. Encourage renewal. Create at least one time during the day when you encourage your people to stop working and take a break. Offer a midafternoon class in yoga, or meditation, organize a group walk or workout, or consider creating a renewal room where people can relax, or take a nap.\n\nIt’s also up to individuals to set their own boundaries. Consider these three behaviors for yourself:\n\n1. Do the most important thing first in the morning, preferably without interruption, for 60 to 90 minutes, with a clear start and stop time. If possible, work in a private space during this period, or with sound-reducing earphones. Finally, resist every impulse to distraction, knowing that you have a designated stopping point. The more absorbed you can get, the more productive you’ll be. When you’re done, take at least a few minutes to renew.\n\n2. Establish regular, scheduled times to think more long term, creatively, or strategically. If you don’t, you’ll constantly succumb to the tyranny of the urgent. Also, find a different environment in which to do this activity — preferably one that’s relaxed and conducive to open-ended thinking.\n\n3. Take real and regular vacations. Real means that when you’re off, you’re truly disconnecting from work. Regular means several times a year if possible, even if some are only two or three days added to a weekend. The research strongly suggests that you’ll be far healthier if you take all of your vacation time, and more productive overall.\n\nA single principle lies at the heart of all these suggestions. When you’re engaged at work, fully engage, for defined periods of time. When you’re renewing, truly renew. Make waves. Stop living your life in the gray zone.\n\nand CEO of The Energy Project and the author of The Way We’re Working Isn’t Working.

Instead of worrying about questions like whether to upsize smartphone apps for tablets, designers should start by asking how their users will physically interact with their devices when using an app.\n\n The technical term for this is input type—keyboard versus touchscreen, one-handed or two-handed interactions, and the like. This requires designers to think about how a device is held, which fingers are used, and how the app in question can optimize the experience for users’ dexterity. \n\n## The Beginning: Start With Responsive Design\n ![](MTIyMzAzNjExMzk1OTI3MzIx.jpg.webp)\n\n For a smartphone, the primary input type has become a single hand with a single finger, typically the thumb. For tablets, it’s two hands with two inputs, typically both thumbs. And for desktops, it’s still restricted largely to the mouse, trackpad, and keyboard, but can branch out in rare circumstances, in the case of devices like the Chromebook Pixel or Microsoft Surface to touchscreen inputs as well. \n\n Wroblewski’s [Polar](http://polarb.com) makes an iOS app that lets users poll friends on any topic and then build communities around these topics. Just last week, Polar launched a desktop Web client that is designed to match not just the look but the functionality of the mobile app versions and the input types taken into account with each one. As you change the size of your window, the app morphs from the desktop version to the tablet/touchscreen computer version, and then down to its smartphone version.\n\n If you resize ReadWrite in a browser window, you’ll see a similar transformation. This is known as responsive design, and it’s an increasingly popular approach to Web design. Last week, at its I/O conference, Google unveiled tools that promise to make it [much easier to build responsive websites](https://readwrite.com/2013/05/15/now-google-wants-to-kill-the-mobile-web).\n\n That way, Polar not only looks the same in-app for the iPhone and iPad as it does on the mobile Web, but it adapts for pretty much every platform for optimal use. It’s not about scaling the layout of interface objects up and down; it’s about scaling the whole experience up or down. \n\n## Next: Think About How We Hold Our Devices\n ![](MTIyMzAzNjE0MDgwMjg3MzM0.jpg.webp)\n\n But responsive design has largely been limited to these screen-size adjustments. Input type may be an even more important concept because it factors in both the physical limitations of the device from a display and functionality standpoint as well as how those limitations translate to our physical interactions with the devices. \n\n Wroblewski detailed the input-type approach to design in a [blog post on May 13](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1721) that covered the app’s new Web client, which lets users quickly scroll through and vote on topic pages related to everything from Star Wars and Game of Thrones to Web design and photography.\n\n “Topic pages on Polar were designed to adapt to not only different screen sizes but to different input types as well,” Wroblewski writes. “The end result is a Web interface that aims to fit into the reality of Web use today. In particular, the human ergonomics of how people interact with different devices …”\n\n It turns out that thinking about ergonomics on mobile devices and adapting design accordingly is not a widely used approach. Steven Hoober, who Wroblewski cites as his primary source for input-type research, published a report earlier this year on UXmatters, [“How Do Users Really Hold Mobile Devices?”](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php?) that collected two months of observations on how more than 1,300 people used their mobile devices. \n\n Hoober’s report aimed to dispel the myth that designers should follow a “best practices” approach to app design that relies on assumptions that cast the widest net. Instead, Hoober advises that the approach should be far more customized, taking into account the constantly changing nature of mobile use that is contingent on factors like device type and screen size as well as physical location, be it standing or sitting on a bus or in a cafe. \n\n “The way in which users hold their phone is not a static state,” Hoober writes. “Users change the way they’re holding their phone very often—sometimes every few seconds.”\n\n ![Usage habits](MTIyMzAzNjE2NDk2MjA2NDM4.jpg.webp)\n\n While Hoober did verify the assumption that majority of smartphone use is done one-handed with the thumb—49% of the time—he also discovered that designing from that standpoint alone could lead users to alter their behavior and thus deemphasize the very reasons underlying the approach.\n\n “What if a user sees buttons at the top, so switches to cradling his phone to more easily reach all functionality on the screen—or just prefers holding it that way all the time?” he explains.  \n\n## Comfort-First Approach\n Wroblewski stresses that Polar was designed primarily to be “comfortable to use,” incorporating the ideas behind Hoober’s findings into the app’s design to cover the best input types for every device.  \n\n For instance, Polar’s smartphone app contains no left-hand column because users wouldn’t typically be able to access it comfortably using one hand and one finger. It does support keyboard use in the event someone is using a large-screen phone-tablet hybrid, also known as a phablet, that’s more typically held with two hands.\n\n By contrast, when using Polar on a full tablet, a browsing column is present to take advantage of two-handed use. That’s placed strategically on the left edge, with voting options on the right to take advantage of quick thumb access to the left and right sides of the screen. \n\n The desktop version of Polar mostly matches the mobile app experience. The main difference: When Polar detects a large enough screen, it adds keyboard support.\n\n This type of comfort-first approach has its downsides.\n\n “Looking at the Polar interface on a laptop can be a bit disconcerting because we’ve essentially left the middle of the page ‘blank,'” Wroblewski says. This runs contrary to the fill-‘et-up instincts of most Web designers, but it’s the only way Polar could create something that easily scales down both aesthetically and functionally from a 27-inch monitor to a 4-inch smartphone screen. \n\n While these methods are very much experimental, they showcase the implementation of a much more sophisticated approach for thinking about mobile app design. We know that the diversity of devices is only increasing. With responsive design, we’ve scrapped a one-size-fits-all approach to screen size. The next step is to discard one-swipe-fits-all thinking about how we interact with those screens.\n\n Photo by [Intel Free Press](https://www.flickr.com/photos/intelfreepress/6837433138/)","source":"_posts/work_仕事/Why-Your-App-Design-Doesn-t-Have-To-Be-All-Thumbs.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Why Your App Design Doesn't Have To Be All Thumbs\ntags:\n  - migrated from FaceBook\nsticky: 999\ncomments: true\nlang: en_US\ntoc: true\ntocOpen: true\nindexing: true\nhome_posts_tag: false\ntop: false\ndonate: false\ngeolocation: 'Saitama, Japan'\ncopyright: false\nmathjax: false\nshare: false\ncategories:\n  - Work_仕事\ndate: 2013-05-24 21:23:00\n---\n SOURCE: https://readwrite.com/2013/05/22/polar-input-types-multiplatform-app-design/\n By: Nick Statt\n Published: 2013 May 22\n\n---\n\n ![The debate about app design largely centers around screen size.](MTIyMzAzNjA5MjQ4NDQ5MTI2.jpg.webp)\n\n What if designers worried about digit size instead?\n\n Luke Wroblewski, a respected designer who sold a company to Twitter and more recently founded Polar, an app maker, thinks it’s time to reconsider mobile design principles.

Instead of worrying about questions like whether to upsize smartphone apps for tablets, designers should start by asking how their users will physically interact with their devices when using an app.</p>\n<p> The technical term for this is input type—keyboard versus touchscreen, one-handed or two-handed interactions, and the like. This requires designers to think about how a device is held, which fingers are used, and how the app in question can optimize the experience for users’ dexterity. </p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Beginning-Start-With-Responsive-Design\"><a href=\"#The-Beginning-Start-With-Responsive-Design\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Beginning: Start With Responsive Design\"></a>The Beginning: Start With Responsive Design</h2><p> <img src=\"/MTIyMzAzNjExMzk1OTI3MzIx.jpg.webp\"></p>\n<p> For a smartphone, the primary input type has become a single hand with a single finger, typically the thumb. For tablets, it’s two hands with two inputs, typically both thumbs. And for desktops, it’s still restricted largely to the mouse, trackpad, and keyboard, but can branch out in rare circumstances, in the case of devices like the Chromebook Pixel or Microsoft Surface to touchscreen inputs as well. </p>\n<p> Wroblewski’s <a href=\"http://polarb.com/\">Polar</a> makes an iOS app that lets users poll friends on any topic and then build communities around these topics. Just last week, Polar launched a desktop Web client that is designed to match not just the look but the functionality of the mobile app versions and the input types taken into account with each one. As you change the size of your window, the app morphs from the desktop version to the tablet&#x2F;touchscreen computer version, and then down to its smartphone version.</p>\n<p> If you resize ReadWrite in a browser window, you’ll see a similar transformation. This is known as responsive design, and it’s an increasingly popular approach to Web design. Last week, at its I&#x2F;O conference, Google unveiled tools that promise to make it <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2013/05/15/now-google-wants-to-kill-the-mobile-web\">much easier to build responsive websites</a>.</p>\n<p> That way, Polar not only looks the same in-app for the iPhone and iPad as it does on the mobile Web, but it adapts for pretty much every platform for optimal use. It’s not about scaling the layout of interface objects up and down; it’s about scaling the whole experience up or down. </p>\n<h2 id=\"Next-Think-About-How-We-Hold-Our-Devices\"><a href=\"#Next-Think-About-How-We-Hold-Our-Devices\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Next: Think About How We Hold Our Devices\"></a>Next: Think About How We Hold Our Devices</h2><p> <img src=\"/MTIyMzAzNjE0MDgwMjg3MzM0.jpg.webp\"></p>\n<p> But responsive design has largely been limited to these screen-size adjustments. Input type may be an even more important concept because it factors in both the physical limitations of the device from a display and functionality standpoint as well as how those limitations translate to our physical interactions with the devices. </p>\n<p> Wroblewski detailed the input-type approach to design in a <a href=\"http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1721\">blog post on May 13</a> that covered the app’s new Web client, which lets users quickly scroll through and vote on topic pages related to everything from Star Wars and Game of Thrones to Web design and photography.</p>\n<p> “Topic pages on Polar were designed to adapt to not only different screen sizes but to different input types as well,” Wroblewski writes. “The end result is a Web interface that aims to fit into the reality of Web use today. In particular, the human ergonomics of how people interact with different devices …”</p>\n<p> It turns out that thinking about ergonomics on mobile devices and adapting design accordingly is not a widely used approach. Steven Hoober, who Wroblewski cites as his primary source for input-type research, published a report earlier this year on UXmatters, <a href=\"http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php\">“How Do Users Really Hold Mobile Devices?”</a> that collected two months of observations on how more than 1,300 people used their mobile devices. </p>\n<p> Hoober’s report aimed to dispel the myth that designers should follow a “best practices” approach to app design that relies on assumptions that cast the widest net. Instead, Hoober advises that the approach should be far more customized, taking into account the constantly changing nature of mobile use that is contingent on factors like device type and screen size as well as physical location, be it standing or sitting on a bus or in a cafe. </p>\n<p> “The way in which users hold their phone is not a static state,” Hoober writes. “Users change the way they’re holding their phone very often—sometimes every few seconds.”</p>\n<p> <img src=\"/MTIyMzAzNjE2NDk2MjA2NDM4.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Usage habits\"></p>\n<p> While Hoober did verify the assumption that majority of smartphone use is done one-handed with the thumb—49% of the time—he also discovered that designing from that standpoint alone could lead users to alter their behavior and thus deemphasize the very reasons underlying the approach.</p>\n<p> “What if a user sees buttons at the top, so switches to cradling his phone to more easily reach all functionality on the screen—or just prefers holding it that way all the time?” he explains.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"Comfort-First-Approach\"><a href=\"#Comfort-First-Approach\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Comfort-First Approach\"></a>Comfort-First Approach</h2><p> Wroblewski stresses that Polar was designed primarily to be “comfortable to use,” incorporating the ideas behind Hoober’s findings into the app’s design to cover the best input types for every device.  </p>\n<p> For instance, Polar’s smartphone app contains no left-hand column because users wouldn’t typically be able to access it comfortably using one hand and one finger. It does support keyboard use in the event someone is using a large-screen phone-tablet hybrid, also known as a phablet, that’s more typically held with two hands.</p>\n<p> By contrast, when using Polar on a full tablet, a browsing column is present to take advantage of two-handed use. That’s placed strategically on the left edge, with voting options on the right to take advantage of quick thumb access to the left and right sides of the screen. </p>\n<p> The desktop version of Polar mostly matches the mobile app experience. The main difference: When Polar detects a large enough screen, it adds keyboard support.</p>\n<p> This type of comfort-first approach has its downsides.</p>\n<p> “Looking at the Polar interface on a laptop can be a bit disconcerting because we’ve essentially left the middle of the page ‘blank,’” Wroblewski says. This runs contrary to the fill-‘et-up instincts of most Web designers, but it’s the only way Polar could create something that easily scales down both aesthetically and functionally from a 27-inch monitor to a 4-inch smartphone screen. </p>\n<p> While these methods are very much experimental, they showcase the implementation of a much more sophisticated approach for thinking about mobile app design. We know that the diversity of devices is only increasing. With responsive design, we’ve scrapped a one-size-fits-all approach to screen size. The next step is to discard one-swipe-fits-all thinking about how we interact with those screens.</p>\n<p> Photo by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/intelfreepress/6837433138/\">Intel Free Press</a></p>\n"},{"title":"Hello World","toc":true,"indexing":false,"date":"2021-05-22T15:00:00.000Z","_content":"Welcome to [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)!

Somewhere people could find a few bits of information about me. I didn't really design it... as the template was free from GoDaddy.com.

Something to add to my skill sets and point visitors to my other online profiles. I never designed it for mobile experience and while it looked _okay_ for the PC, it didn't scale very well.

It can't be just a crappy excuse of a CV either. Besides I have LinkedIn for that... It must keep visitors engaged. Everyone wants to learn \"who is Richie Bartlett?\" And, why should they care when the old site did so little to keep them... \n \n So, I've commissioned some help to build an awesome design. Over the next few weeks, visit again and watch the new website grow. I'm sure there will be plenty of little things that need attention and enhancement.\n\n\n## Why not another single page site?\n As I would like to better understand what visitors are doing on my site, I've decided to break it into multiple pages as this makes it very easy to review from the access logs on the back-end. Pages that get more traffic will get more attention and will be made easier to reach. \n\n\n ## Add a blog\n  Also, I will merge the designs for the main site and the blog subdomain. The main site will come first. Then the blog will be redesigned to match and blend with the main website.

Something to add to my skill sets and point visitors to my other online profiles. I never designed it for mobile experience and while it looked _okay_ for the PC, it didn't scale very well.

It can't be just a crappy excuse of a CV either. Besides I have LinkedIn for that... It must keep visitors engaged. Everyone wants to learn \"who is Richie Bartlett?\" And, why should they care when the old site did so little to keep them... \n \n So, I've commissioned some help to build an awesome design. Over the next few weeks, visit again and watch the new website grow. I'm sure there will be plenty of little things that need attention and enhancement.\n\n\n## Why not another single page site?\n As I would like to better understand what visitors are doing on my site, I've decided to break it into multiple pages as this makes it very easy to review from the access logs on the back-end. Pages that get more traffic will get more attention and will be made easier to reach. \n\n\n ## Add a blog\n  Also, I will merge the designs for the main site and the blog subdomain. The main site will come first. Then the blog will be redesigned to match and blend with the main website. The layout will be slightly different between the two, but overall theme will be the same. \n  ","slug":"work_仕事/Projects/Redesigning-RichieBartlett-com","published":1,"updated":"2022-04-12T18:53:07.325Z","_id":"cl1wm5ajy0024isuy56pg5784","layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<h2 id=\"The-old-website\"><a href=\"#The-old-website\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The old website\"></a>The old website</h2><p>  Originally, I used my domain name <code>RichieBartlett.com</code> for email and a landing page.

However, the biggest developments are often anticipated decades in advance. In 1945 Vannevar Bush described what he-called the “[Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex)\", a single device that would store all books, records and communications, and mechanically link them together by association. This concept was then used to formulate the idea of “hypertext” (a term coined two decades later), which in turn guided the development of the World Wide Web (developed another two decades later). The “Streaming Wars” have only just begun, yet the first streaming video took place more than 25 years ago. What’s more, many of the attributes of this so-called war have been hypothesized for decades, such as virtually infinite supplies of content, on-demand playback, interactivity, dynamic and personalized ads, and the value of converging content with distribution.\n\n In this sense, the rough outlines of future solutions are often understood and, in a sense, agreed upon well in advance of the technical capacity to produce them. Still, it’s often impossible to predict how they’ll fall into place, which features matter more or less, what sort of governance models or competitive dynamics will drive them, or what new experiences will be produced. By the time Netflix launched its streaming service, much of Hollywood knew that the future of television was online (IP TV had been deployed in the late 1999s). \n \n {% twitter https://twitter.com/ballmatthew/status/1146081701535330305?s=20 %}\n The challenge was timing and [how to package such a service](https://redef.com/original/the-digital-future-of-tv-networks-the-original-series-crunch) (it took another 10 years for Hollywood to accept all of their channels, genres and content needs to be collapsed into a single app/brand). The popularity of video game broadcasting and YouTubers still elude many in the media industry, as does the idea that the best way to monetize content might be to give it away for free and charge for optional $0.99 items of no consequential value. The acquisition of media conglomerate Time Warner by landline internet giant AOL was set in 2000 based on the idea media and tech/distribution needed to converge, but was unwound in 2009 after it failed to produce much benefit. Nine years later, it was then bought by mobile internet giant AT&T under the same premise.\n\n While many technologists imagined some sort of “personal computer”, its attributes and timing were so unpredictable that Microsoft dominated the PC era that began in the 1990s rather than the mainframe domineer IBM. And while Microsoft [clearly foresaw mobile](https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1214924421476929536?s=20), it misread the role of the operating system and too much of the hardware, hence the rise of iOS and Android globally (and Microsoft’s shift from the OS layer to the app/services one). In a similar sense, Steve Jobs’ priorities for computing were always “right”, they were just too early and focused on the wrong device. More broadly, the two most dominant cases of the early Internet were instant messaging and email, and yet the importance of social apps/networks was still unexpected until the late 2000s. And for that matter, all of the prerequisites for building Facebook existed pre-Y2K, but Facebook didn't come along until 2005 – and even then, it was an accident.\n\n Since the late 1970s and early 1980s, many of those in the technology community have imagined a future state of, if not quasi-successor to, the Internet – called the “Metaverse”. And it would revolutionize not just the infrastructure layer of the digital world, but also much of the physical one, as well as all the services and platforms atop them, how they work, and what they sell. Although the full vision for the Metaverse remains hard to define, seemingly fantastical, and decades away, the pieces have started to feel very real. And as always with this sort of change, its arc is as long and unpredictable as its end state is lucrative.\n\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To this end, the Metaverse has become the newest macro-goal for many of the world’s tech giants. As I outlined in<a href=\"https://redef.com/original/fortnite-is-the-future-but-probably-not-for-the-reasons-you-think\"> February of 2019</a>, it is the express goal of Epic Games, maker of the <em>Unreal Engine</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>. It is also <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10111311886191191\">the driver</a> behind Facebook’s purchase of Oculus VR and its newly announced Horizon virtual world/meeting space, among<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/to-control-its-destiny-facebook-bets-big-on-hardware\"> many, many other projects</a>, such as AR glasses and brain-to-machine communications. The tens of billions that will be <a href=\"https://redef.com/original/how-cloud-gaming-will-and-wont-disrupt\">spent on cloud gaming</a> over the next decade, too, is based on the belief that such technologies will underpin our online-offline future.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Ultimately, you’ll find many of the same items in the offices of Big Tech CEOs. However, the most well-worn is likely to be a copy of Neal Stephenson’s <em>Snow Crash</em>, which first described and essentially coined the terms “Metaverse” and “Avatar”. And there are many reasons why.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"> </p>\n \n \n ## CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS THE “METAVERSE”?\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The most common conceptions of the Metaverse stem from science fiction. Here, the Metaverse is typically portrayed as a sort of digital “jacked-in” internet – a manifestation of actual reality, but one based in a virtual (often theme park-like) world, such those portrayed in <em>Ready Player One</em> and <em>The Matrix</em>. And while these sorts of experience are likely to be an <em>aspect</em> of the Metaverse, this conception is limited in the same way movies like <em>Tron </em>portrayed the Internet as a literal digital “information superhighway” of bits. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Just as it was hard to envision in 1982 what the Internet of 2020 would be — and harder still to communicate it to those who had never even “logged” onto it at that time — we don’t really know how to describe the Metaverse. However, we can identify core attributes.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Metaverse, we think, will...</p><ol data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Be persistent</strong> – which is to say, it never “resets” or “pauses” or “ends”, it just continues indefinitely</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Be synchronous and live </strong>– even though pre-scheduled and self-contained events will happen, just as they do in “real life”, the Metaverse will be a living experience that exists consistently for everyone and in real-time</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Be without any cap to concurrent users, while also providing each user with an individual sense of “presence” </strong>– everyone can be a part of the Metaverse and participate in a specific event/place/activity together, at the same time and with individual agency</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Be a fully functioning economy </strong>– individuals and businesses will be able to create, own, invest, sell, and be rewarded for an incredibly wide range of “work” that produces “value” that is recognized by others</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Be an experience that spans </strong>both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Offer unprecedented interoperability </strong>of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences – your “Counter-Strike” gun skin, for example, could also be used to decorate a gun in <em>Fortnite</em>, or be gifted to a friend on/through Facebook. Similarly, a car designed for <em>Rocket League</em> (or even for Porsche’s website) could be brought over to work in <em>Roblox. </em>Today, the digital world basically acts as though it were a mall where every store used its own currency, required proprietary ID cards, had proprietary units of measurement for things like shoes or calories, and different dress codes, etc.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Be populated by “content” and “experiences” <strong>created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors</strong>, some of whom are independent individuals, while others might be informally organized groups or commercially-focused enterprises</p></li></ol><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There are a few other ideas that may be core to the Metaverse, but are not widely agreed upon. One of these concerns is whether participants will have a single consistent digital identity (or “avatar”) that they will use across all experiences. This would have practical value but is probably unlikely as each of the leaders in the “Metaverse era” will still want their own identity systems. Today, for example, there are a few dominant account systems – but none have exhaustive coverage of the web and they often stack atop one another with only limited data sharing/access (e.g. your iPhone is based around an iOS account, then you might log into an app using your Facebook ID, which itself is your Gmail account). </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There is also disagreement on how much interoperability is required for the Metaverse to really be “the Metaverse”, rather than just an evolution of today’s Internet. Many also debate whether a true Metaverse can have a single operator (as is the case in <em>Ready Player One</em>). Some believe the definition (and success) of a Metaverse requires it to be a heavily decentralized platform built mostly upon community-based standards and protocols (like the open web) and an “open source” Metaverse OS or platform (this doesn’t mean there won’t be dominant closed platforms in the Metaverse).</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Another idea relates to the fundamental communications architecture of the Metaverse. This is described in more detail later in the piece, but while today’s Internet is structured around individual servers “talking” to one another on an as-needed basis, some believe the Metaverse needs be “wired” and “operated” around persistent many-to-many connections. But even here, there’s no consensus around exactly how this would work, nor the degree of decentralization required. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It’s also helpful to consider what the Metaverse is often, but incorrectly, likened to. While each of these analogies is likely to be a part of the Metaverse, they aren’t actually the Metaverse. For example, The Metaverse is not…</p><ol data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A “virtual world”</strong> – Virtual worlds and games with AI driven characters have existed for decades, as have those populated with “real” humans in real time. This isn’t a “meta” (Greek for “beyond”) universe, just a synthetic and fictional one designed for a single purpose (a game).</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A “virtual space”</strong> – Digital content experiences like <em>Second Life</em> are often seen as “proto-Metaverses” because they (A) lack game-like goals or skill systems; (B) are virtual hangouts that persist; (C) offer nearly synchronous content updates; and (D) have real humans represented by digital avatars. However, these are not sufficient attributes for the Metaverse. </p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>“Virtual reality”</strong> – VR is a way to experience a virtual world or space. Sense of presence in a digital world doesn’t make a Metaverse. It is like saying you have a thriving city because you can see and walk around it.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A “digital and virtual economy”</strong> – These, too, already exist. Individual games such as <em>World of Warcraft</em> have long had functioning economies where real people trade virtual goods for real money, or perform virtual tasks in exchange for real money. In addition, platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, as well as technologies such as Bitcoin, are based around the hiring of individuals/businesses/computational power to perform virtual and digital tasks. We are already transacting at scale for purely digital items for purely digital activities via purely digital marketplaces.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A “game”</strong> – <em>Fortnite</em> has many elements of the Metaverse. It (A) mashes up IP; (B) has a consistent identity that spans multiple closed platforms; (C) is a gateway to a myriad of experiences, some of which are purely social; (D) compensates creators for creating content, etc. However, as is the case with <em>Ready Player One</em>, it remains too narrow in what it does, how far it extends, and what “work” can occur (at least for now). While the Metaverse may have some game-like goals, include games, and involve gamification, it is not itself a game, nor is it oriented around specific objectives.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A “virtual theme park or Disneyland” </strong>– Not only will the “attractions” be infinite, they will be not be centrally “designed” or programmed like Disneyland, nor will they all be about fun or entertainment. In addition, the distribution of engagement will have a very long tail</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A “new app store” </strong>– No one needs another way to open apps, nor would doing so “in VR” (as an example) unlock/enable the sorts of value supposed by a successor Internet. The Metaverse is substantively different from today’s Internet/mobile models, architecture, and priorities.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A “new UGC platform” - </strong>The Metaverse is not just another YouTube or Facebook-like platform in which countless individuals can “create”, “share”, and “monetize” content, and where the most popular content represents only the tiniest share of overall consumption. The Metaverse will be a place in which proper empires are invested in and built, and where these richly capitalized businesses can fully own a customer, control APIs/data, unit economics, etc. In addition, it’s likely that, as with the web, a dozen or so platforms hold significant shares of user time, experiences, content, etc.</p></li></ol><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>(If you want a simpler way to think about the Metaverse, you can imagine it as the </em>Nightmare Before Christmas<em> – you can walk into any experience or activity, and potentially address almost any of your needs, from a single starting point or world that’s also populated by everyone else you know. This is why hypertext is such a key example. But what’s important is to recognize the Metaverse isn’t a game, a piece of hardware, or an online experience. This is like saying is ‘World of Warcraft’, the iPhone, or Google is the Internet. They are digital worlds, devices, services, websites, etc. The Internet is a wide set of protocols, technology, tubes and languages, plus access devices and content and communication experiences atop them. Metaverse will be too.)</em></p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n \n \n ## CHAPTER 2: WHY DOES THE METAVERSE MATTER?\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Even if the Metaverse falls short of the fantastical visions captured by science fiction authors, it is likely to produce trillions in value as a new computing platform or content medium. But in its full vision, the Metaverse becomes the gateway to most digital experiences, a key component of all physical ones, and the next great labor platform.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The value of being a key participant, if not a driver, of such a system is self-evident – there is no “owner” of the Internet today, but nearly all of the leading Internet companies rank among the 10 most valuable public companies on earth. And if the Metaverse does indeed serve as a functional “successor” to the web — only this time with even greater reach, time spent, and more commercial activity — there’s likely to be even more economic upside. Regardless, the Metaverse should produce the same diversity of opportunity as we saw with the web – new companies, products and services will emerge to manage everything from payment processing to identity verification, hiring, ad delivery, content creation, security, and so forth. This, in turn, will mean many present-day incumbents are likely to fall.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">More broadly, the Metaverse stands to alter how we allocate and monetize modern resources. For centuries, developed economies have transformed as the scarcity of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Rethinking-Economics-Land-Housing-Ryan-Collins/dp/1786991187\">labor and real-estate waxed and waned</a>. Under the Metaverse, would-be laborers who choose to live outside cities will be able to participate in the “high value” economy via virtual labor. As more consumer spending shifts to virtual goods, services, and experiences, we’ll also see further shifts in where we live, the infrastructure that’s built, and who performs which tasks. Consider, for example, “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming\">Gold Farming</a>”. Not long after in-game trade economies emerged, many “players” – often employed by a larger company and typically in lower-income countries — would spend a workday collecting digital resources for sale inside or outside the game. These sales were typically to higher-income players in the West. And while this “labor” is typically menial, repetitive, and limited to a few applications, the diversity and value of this “work” will grow as the Metaverse itself does.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">  </p>\n\n\n ## CHAPTER 3: HOW DOES ONE SIMPLY BUILD A METAVERSE?\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Metaverse will require countless new technologies, protocols, companies, innovations, and discoveries to work. And it won’t directly come into existence; there will be no clean “Before Metaverse” and “After Metaverse”. Instead, it will slowly emerge over time as different products, services, and capabilities integrate and meld together. However, it’s helpful to think of three core elements that need to come into place.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"> <em>(One way I try to think about these three areas is via the Book of Genesis – first, “God” must create the underlying universe (“concurrency infrastructure”), then s/he must define its laws of physics and rules (“standards and protocols”), then s/he must fill it with life (“content”) that’s worthwhile, evolves, and iterates against selection pressures. God, in other words, doesn’t create and design the world as though it were a miniature model, but enables one to grow across a mostly blank tableau etc.)</em></p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n\n ### Concurrency Infrastructure\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">At a foundational level, the technology simply does not yet exist for there to be hundreds, let alone millions of people participating in a shared, synchronous experience. Consider<a href=\"https://redef.com/original/fortnite-is-the-future-but-probably-not-for-the-reasons-you-think\"><em> Fortnite</em>’s 2019 Marshmello concert</a>. An astounding 11MM people experienced the event in real time. However, they did not do so together. In truth, there were more than 100,000 instances of the Marshmello concert, all of which were slightly out of sync and capped at 100 players per instance. Epic can probably do more than this today, but not into several hundred, let alone millions.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Not only does the Metaverse require infrastructure that currently does not exist, the Internet was never designed for anything near this experience. After all, it was designed to share files from one computer to another. As a result, most of the Internet’s underlying systems are oriented around one server talking to one other server or an end-user device. This model continues today. There are billions of people on today’s Facebook, for example, but each user shares an individual connection with the Facebook server, not with any other user.<strong> </strong>Accordingly, when you access content from another user, you’re really just pulling the latest information that Facebook is giving you. The earliest form of pseudo-synchronous programs were text chats, but you’re still just pushing largely static data to a server and pulling the latest information from it when/where/how/as it’s needed. The Internet simply wasn’t designed for persistent (versus continuous) communication, let alone persistent communication that is synchronized in precise real time to countless others. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To operate, the Metaverse requires something more akin to video conferencing and video games. These experiences work because of persistent connections that update each other in real-time and with a degree of accuracy that other programs don’t generally need. However, they tend not to have high levels of concurrency: most video chat programs max out beyond a few people, and once you hit 50, you tend to need to “live stream” a broadcast to your viewers, rather than share a two-way connection. To this end, these experiences neither need to be, nor are they, exactly live. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To this end, part of the reason that the battle royale genre is only recently popular in video games now is because it’s only recently possible to play live with so many other users. Although some games with highest concurrencies have existed for more than twenty years, such as <em>Second Life</em> or <em>Warcraft</em>, they essentially spoofed the experience by “sharding” and splitting users into different “worlds” and servers. <em>Eve Online</em>, for example, can technically have more than 100,000 players “in the same game”, but they are split across different galaxies (i.e. server nodes). As a result, a player only really sees or interacts with a small handful of other players at any one time. In addition, traveling to another galaxy means disconnecting from one server and loading another (which the game is able to narratively “hide” by forcing players to jump to light speed in order to cross the vastness of space). And if/when <em>Eve Online</em> did get to battles involving hundreds of users, the system slowed to a crawl. And this still worked because the gameplay dynamic was based on predominantly large-scale, pre-planned ship-based combat. If it was a “fast-twitch” game such as <em>Rocket League</em> or <em>Call of Duty</em>, these slowdowns would have been unplayable.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">A number of companies are working hard to solve this problem, such as the aptly named Improbable. But this is an enormous computational challenge and one that fights against the underlying design/intent of the Internet. </p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n \n \n ### Standards, Protocols, and their Adoption\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Internet as we experience it today works because of standards and protocols for visual presentation, file loading, communications, graphics, data, and so forth. These include everything from consumer-recognizable .GIFs filetypes to the websocket protocol that underlies almost every form of real-time communication between a browser and other servers on the internet. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Metaverse will require an even broader, more complex, and resilient set of S&amp;Ps. What’s more, the importance of interoperability and live synchronous experiences means we’ll need to prune some existing standards and “standardize” around a smaller set per function. Today, for example, there are a multitude of image file formats: .GIF, .JPEG, .PNG, .BMP, .TIFF, .WEBP, etc. And while the web today is built on open standards, much of it is closed and proprietary. Amazon and Facebook and Google use similar technologies, but they aren’t designed to transition into one another — just as Ford’s wheels aren’t designed to fit a GM chassis. In addition, these companies are incredibly resistant to cross-integrating their systems or sharing their data. Such moves might raise the overall value of the “digital economy”, but also weakens their hyper-valuable network effects and makes it easier for a user to move their digital lives elsewhere.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This will be enormously difficult and take decades. And the more valuable and interoperable the Metaverse is, the harder it will be to establish industry-wide consensus around topics such as data security, data persistence, forward compatible code evolution, and transactions. In addition, the Metaverse will need altogether new rules for censorship, control of communications, regulatory enforcement, tax reporting, the prevention of online radicalization, and many more challenges that we’re still struggling with today.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">While the establishments of standards usually involve actual meetings, negotiations, and debates, the standards for the Metaverse won’t be established upfront. The standard process is much messier and organic, with meetings and opinions changing on an ad hoc basis. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To use a meta analogy for the Metaverse, consider <em>SimCity</em>. In ideal circumstances, the “Mayor” (i.e. player) would first design their mega-metropolis, then build from day one to this final vision. But in the game, as with real life, you can’t just “build” a 10MM person city. You start with a small town and optimize for it first (e.g. where the roads are, schools are, utility capacity, etc.). As it grows, you build around this town, occasionally but judiciously tearing down and replacing “old” sections, sometimes only if/when a problem (insufficient supply of power) or disaster hits (a fire). But unlike <em>SimCity</em>, there will be many mayors, not one — and their desires and incentives will often conflict. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We don’t know exactly what the Metaverse will need, let alone which existing standards will transfer over, how, to what effects, when, or through which applications and groups. As a result, it’s important to consider <em>how</em> the Metaverse emerges, not just around which technological standard.</p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n \n \n ### The ‘On-Ramp’ Experience\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Just as the standards for the Metaverse can’t simply be “declared”, consumers and businesses won’t embrace a would-be proto-Metaverse simply because it’s available.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Consider the real world. Just making a mall capable of fitting a hundred thousand people or a hundred shops doesn’t mean it attracts a single consumer or brand. “Town squares” emerge organically around existing infrastructure and behaviors, to fulfill existing civilian and commercial needs. Ultimately, any place of congregation — be it a bar, basement, park, museum or merry go-round — is attended because of who or what is already there, not because it’s a place in of itself.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The same is true of digital experiences. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, didn’t work because it announced it would be a “social network”, but because it emerged first as a campus hot-or-not, then became a digital yearbook turned photo-sharing and messaging service. As with Facebook, the Metaverse needs to be “populated”, rather than just “populable”, and this population must then fill in this digital world with things to do and content to consume.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This is why considering <em>Fortnite</em> as video game or interactive experience is to think too small and too immediately. <em>Fortnite</em> began as a game, but it quickly evolved into a social square. Its players aren’t logging in to “play”, per se, but to be with their virtual and real-world friends. Teenagers in the 1970s to 2010s would come home and spend three hours talking on the phone. Now they talk to their friends on <em>Fortnite</em>, but not about <em>Fortnite</em>. Instead, they talk about school, movies, sports, news, boys, girls and more. After all, <em>Fortnite</em> doesn’t have a story or IP – the plot is what happens on it and who is there.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Furthermore, <em>Fortnite</em> is rapidly becoming a medium through which other brands, IP, and stories express themselves. Most famously, this includes last year’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBsCzN-jfvA\">live Marshmello concert</a>. However, such examples have rapidly expanded since. In December 2019, <em>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</em> released a clip of the hotly-anticipated film exclusively in <em>Fortnite</em> as part of a larger, in-game <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8M72aZsI2E\">audience-interactive</a> event that included a live interview with director J.J. Abrams. What’s more, this event was <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/12/20/21031513/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-fortnite-opening-crawl-palpatines-message\">explicitly referenced in the opening moments</a> of the film. The band Weezer produced a bespoke island where fans could get an <a href=\"https://www.stereogum.com/2034103/weezer-the-black-album-fortnite-weezer-island/news/\">exclusive first listen</a> to their new album (while dancing with other “players”. <em>Fortnite</em> has also produced several themed “limited-time modes” involving the likes of <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/5/22/18634329/fortnite-jumpman-air-jordan-skins-hang-time-nike\">Nike’s Air Jordan</a> and Lionsgate’s <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/5/16/18627662/fortnite-john-wick-ltm-skin-mode-tokens-loot-pc-ps4-xbox-one-nintendo-switch\">John Wick film series</a>. In some cases, these “LTMs” transform part of <em>Fortnite</em>’s map into a mini-virtual world that, when entered, changes the aesthetics, items and playstyle of the game to resemble another. This has included the universe of the game Borderlands, Batman’s hometown of Gotham, and the old west.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To this end, <em>Fortnite</em> is one of the few places where the IP of Marvel and DC intersects. You can literally wear a Marvel character’s costume inside Gotham City, while interacting with those wearing legally licensed NFL uniforms. This sort of thing hasn’t really happened before. But it will be critical to the Metaverse.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">More broadly, a whole sub-economy on <em>Fortnite</em> has emerged where “players” can build (and monetize) their own content. This can be as small as digital outfits (“skins”) or dances (“emotes”). However, it has rapidly expanded into creating all new games and experience using <em>Fortnite</em>’s engine, assets, and aesthetics. This includes everything from simple treasure hunts, to immersive mash-ups of the <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/6/20699692/fortnite-battle-royale-creative-mode-epic-games\">Brothers Grimm with parkour culture</a>, to a <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/some-people-made-an-entire-sci-fi-game-inside-of-fortni-1840069759\">10-hour sci-fi story that spans multiple dimensions and timelines</a>. In fact, <em>Fortnite</em>’s Creative Mode, already feels like a proto-Metaverse. Here, a player loads their avatar — one specific to them and which is used in all <em>Fortnite</em>-related experiences — and lands in a game-like lobby and can choose from thousands of “doors” (i.e. space-time rifts) that send them to one of thousands of different worlds with up to 99 other players.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This speaks to the longer term-vision for the game, one that creative director Donald Mustard is increasingly clear about. <em>Fortnite</em> isn’t the Metaverse, but nothing is closer to the Metaverse today in spirit and it is clear how the “game” might eventually underpin one.</p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n \n \n ### Epic Games’ Epic Game Plan\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The best example of <em>Fortnite</em>’s potential is demonstrated by its ability to persuade many supposed competitors into cooperation (or early “interoperability”) with one another. Today, <em>Fortnite</em> works across each major entertainment platform – iOS, Android, PlayStation, Nintendo, PC, Xbox — allowing full cross-play that spans multiple identity/account systems, payment methods, social graphs, and typically closed ecosystems. For years, this was heavily resisted by the major gaming platforms as they believed that enabling such an experience would undermine their network effects and reduce the need to buy their proprietary hardware. As a result, a friend with <em>Call of Duty</em> on PlayStation could never play with their friend with <em>Call of Duty</em> on Xbox, even though both Sony and Microsoft knew they wanted to. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Similarly, it’s unusual for IP owners to allow their characters and stories to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ballmatthew/status/1179444988326760448?s=20\">intermingled with other IP</a>. This does happen from time to time (e.g. there are several Marvel v DC comic book crossovers and video games). But it’s particularly rare to see it crossed over in an experience they don’t control editorially, let alone one based around unpredictability (not even the creative team behind <em>Fortnite</em> knows what it will do in 2021) and with such a wide range of IP.</p>\n \n   {% twitter https://twitter.com/juliey4/status/1205393085145874433 %}\n\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This organic evolution can’t be overemphasized. If you “declared” your intent to start a Metaverse, these parties would never embrace interoperability or entrust their IP. But <em>Fortnite</em> has become so popular and so unique that most counterparties have no choice but to participate – in fact, they’re probably desperate to integrate into the “game” – just as P&amp;G can’t say “eh, Facebook isn’t for us”. <em>Fortnite</em> is too valuable a platform.</p>\n\n  {% twitter https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1210291961904730114 %}\n\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">At the same time, Epic is bringing far more than a plausible on-ramp to its efforts to build the Metaverse. In addition to operating <em>Fortnite</em> — which was in theory a side project — Epic Games also owns the second largest independent gaming engine, Unreal. This means thousands of games already operate on its “stack” of tools and software (to simplify things), making it easier to share assets, integrate experiences, and share user profiles. Over time, the sophistication of Epic’s gaming engine has grown so significant it now powers a variety of traditional media experiences. Disney’s <em>The Mandalorian</em> was shot and fully rendered in Unreal, with director Jon Favreau able to literally enter its digital sets to frame a shot and position characters. If Disney so chooses, audiences could freely investigate much of these sets — most of the environment and assets already exist. And outside film and TV, Unreal is increasingly being used for live events, too: Unreal powers Fox Sports’s NASCAR set, for example.</p>\n \n ### Real-Time In-Camera VFX for Next-Gen Filmmaking - Video (2 minutes)\n  Real-time technology is transforming the art of filmmaking, with next-generation virtual production tools coming to Unreal Engine. At SIGGRAPH, Epic Games partnered with Lux Machina, Magnopus, Profile Studios, Quixel, ARRI, and DP Matt Workman to demonstrate how LED walls can provide not only virtual environments but also lighting for real-world elements, so the entire scene can be captured in camera in a single pass.\n {% youtuber video bErPsq5kPzE %}\n  allowfullscreen: 1,\n  autoplay: 0,\n  hl: en,\n  cc_lang_pref: en,\n  cc_load_policy: 1,\n  color: white,\n  controls: 1,\n  disablekb: 0,\n  enablejsapi: 1,\n  fs: 0,\n  iv_load_policy: 3,\n  loop: 0,\n  modestbranding: 1,\n  playsinline: 0,\n  privacy_mode: yes,\n  rel: 0,\n  showinfo: 0,\n  origin: blog.richiebartlett.com,\n  widget_referrer: blog.richiebartlett.com\n{% endyoutuber %}\n \n\n\n\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Still<strong>,</strong> the Metaverse requires everyone be able to create and contribute ‘content’ and ‘experiences,’ not just well-staffed corporations and technically skilled individuals trying to make games or movies. To this end, Epic acquired the company <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/twinmotion\">Twinmotion</a> in April of last year. The company was/is focused not on VFX engineers or game designers, but on offering intuitive, icon-based software that enables “architecture, construction, urban planning and landscaping professionals” to produce realistic, immersive digital environments based in Unreal “in seconds”. According to Epic Games Founder/CEO Tim Sweeney, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHemFyNcTZo\">this means that there are now three ways to create in Unreal</a>: the standard “coding” engine itself, the more simplified and “visual” Twinmotion, and <em>Fortnite</em> Creative Mode for those with no experience in programming and design. Over time, each option is likely to become more capable, easier to use and integrated.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Another increasingly important part of Epic’s offering is its “Online Services” suite, which allows developers to immediately support cross-play across Sony + Microsoft + Nintendo + PC + iOS + Android and leverage Epic’s account systems/social graph (which has 1.6B player connections). This itself isn’t that unique — Microsoft spent $400MM acquiring PlayFab and millions more to support Xbox Live, while Amazon has bought both GameSparks and GameLift in order to sell services to game developers that need lots of servers and tools for their online games to work. Valve doesn’t offer server infrastructure, but its Steamworks solution gives developers match-making and account services for free — but only for the Steam Store, Valve’s core business. This reveals Epic’s play with Online Services. Unlike today’s market leaders, Epic doesn’t charge. It’s also available free to any engine, any platform, and any game. And it operates at the scale of <em>Fortnite</em>’s player network, allowing any title to leverage the world’s largest player graph to kickstart their userbases. There is obviously value in such an offering, but to Epic, it is “more valuable if free” as it extends the company’s already enormous social graph, makes it much easier for more games to “talk to” one another, and enables players to more seamlessly jump from experience to experience. All of this, too, diminishes Epic’s reliance upon <em>Fortnite</em> when it comes to building the Metaverse. And while Epic Online Services are still in private beta, the company has suggested it will be publicly available in Q2 2020 and should support “hundreds or thousands of games in 2020”. Note, too, that this all reduces Epic’s reliance on <em>Fortnite</em> in its long-term efforts to build the Metaverse.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Epic also operates one of the largest (albeit a still small) digital game store – which means players already access a wide variety of digital content and experiences through Epic. Few consumers were clamoring for greater fragmentation of digital content, and most were reasonably happy with market leader Steam. However, Epic Games Founder/CEO Tim Sweeney has been vocal about the fact that today’s standard 30% commissions for digital content sales (e.g. iOS or Amazon or Google Play) are not just usurious, they prevent the creation of a real digital world economy. Just imagine, for example, if credit card fees weren’t 0.5-2.5% but up to 60-20x as much; whole sectors of the physical economy wouldn’t be able to operate (such as a coffee shop or grocery store). To this end, Epic charges only 12% (which includes the 5% Unreal licensing fee, too, making it only 7% for many customers). Notably, rumors persist that Sweeney had fought for even lower fees but settled with his board at 12% – a sum he himself admits doesn’t always cover operating costs. This doesn’t mean there isn’t an overall business here – and operating a storefront will doubtlessly help build the Metaverse – but Sweeney’s efforts seem much broader. He openly implores Google and Apple, which generate several thousand times the revenue of Epic’s fledgling store, to match Epic’s rates.</p>\n \n   {% twitter https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1216089159946948620 %}\n\n ## CHAPTER 4: WHO ELSE CAN BUILD THE METAVERSE?\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Although the Metaverse has the potential to succeed the Internet as a computing platform, its underlying development process is likely to share little in common with its antecedent. The Internet came from public research universities and US government programs. This was in part because few in private business understood the commercial potential of a World Wide Web, but it was also true that these groups were essentially the only entities with the computational talent, resources, and ambitions to build it. None of this is true when it comes to the Metaverse.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Not only is private industry fully aware of the potential of the Metaverse, it probably has the most aggressive conviction in this future, not to mention the most cash (at least when it comes from a willingness to fund Metaverse R&amp;D), the best engineering talent, and greatest desire for conquest. The major tech companies don’t just want to lead the Metaverse, they want to own and define it. There will still be a large role for open-source projects with non-corporate ethos — and they will attract some of the most interesting creative talent in the Metaverse — but there are only a few likely leaders in the early Metaverse. And you’ll recognize each one.</p>\n \n ### Microsoft is a good example. \n The company has hundreds of millions of federated user identities via Office 365 and LinkedIn, is the second largest cloud vendor in the world, has an extensive suite of work-related software and services that span all systems/platforms/infrastructure, clear technical experience in massive shared online content/operations, and a set of potential gateway experiences via Minecraft, Xbox + Xbox Live, and HoloLens. To this end, the Metaverse offers Microsoft the opportunity to reclaim the OS/hardware leadership it ceded during the handoff from PC to mobile. But more importantly, CEO Satya Nadella understands Microsoft, at a minimum, needs to be wherever work happens. Having successfully adapted from enterprise to consumer, PC to mobile, and offline to online, all while maintaining a dominant role in the “work” economy, it’s hard to envision Microsoft won’t be a primary driver in the virtualized future of labor and information processing.</p>\n \n ### Although Facebook\n CEO Mark Zuckerberg has not explicitly declared his intent to develop and own the Metaverse, his obsession with it seems <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/to-control-its-destiny-facebook-bets-big-on-hardware\">fairly clear</a>. And this is smart. More than any other company, Facebook has the most to lose from the Metaverse as it will build an even larger and more capable social graph and represent both a new computing platform and a new engagement platform. At the same time, the Metaverse also allows Facebook to extend its reach up and down the stack. Despite several efforts to build a smartphone OS and deploy consumer hardware, Facebook remains the one FAAMG company stuck purely at the app/service layer. Through the Metaverse, Facebook could become the next Android or iOS/iPhone (hence Oculus), not to mention a virtual goods version of Amazon.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Facebook’s Metaverse advantages are immense. It has more users, daily usage and user-generated content created each day than any other platform on earth, as well as the second largest share of digital ad spend, billions in cash, thousands of world-class engineers, and conviction from a founder with majority voting rights. Its Metaverse-oriented assets are also growing rapidly and now include patents for semiconductor and brain-to-machine computing interfaces. At the same time, Facebook has a very troubled track record as a platform for where third-party developers/companies can build sustainable businesses, as a ringleader in a consortium (e.g. Libra), and in managing user data/trust. </p>\n \n ### Amazon\n is interesting in a few regards. Most obviously, it will always want to be the primary place in which we buy ‘stuff.’ Whether that’s bought inside a game engine, a virtual world, or web browser is irrelevant (it already sells inside Twitch). In addition, the company already has hundreds of millions of credit cards, the largest share of ecommerce globally (ex-China), is the world’s largest cloud vendor, operates numerous different consumer media experiences (video, music, ebooks, audiobooks, video game broadcasting, etc.) and third-party commerce platforms (e.g. Fulfilled by Amazon, Amazon Channels), is building what they hope will be the first major gaming/rendering engine purpose-designed for the cloud computing era, reportedly working on AR glasses, and is the leader in in-home/office digital assistants. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">More importantly, Founder/CEO Jeff Bezos feels very strongly about underlying infrastructure plays. The web, for example, runs on AWS (Amazon’s best business). 80% of its revenue is actually via “Fulfilled by Amazon,” where the company sells, packages, and delivers products sold by other businesses, instead of Amazon buying and then selling the inventory directly (like most retailers). And while the goal of Elon Musk’s private aerospace company, SpaceX, is to colonize mars, Bezos has been clear his goal with Blue Origin is to facilitate the buildout of space infrastructure similar to early web protocols and his AWS, so that “we could build gigantic chip factories in space and just send little bits down.” To this end, Amazon is likely to be more supportive of a truly “open” Metaverse than any other FAAMG company — it doesn’t need to control the UX or ID because it benefits from enormous increases in back-end infrastructure usage and digital transactions.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Internet is a mine of data and the Metaverse will have both more data and perhaps greater returns on it than today’s web. And no one monetizes this data better at global scale than <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Google</strong></span>. In addition, the company is not just the market leader in indexing both the digital and physical world (nearly 10,000 employees contribute to its mapping initiatives), but it is also the most successful digital software and services company outside of China. It also operates the most used operating system on earth (Android), as well as the most open of the major consumer computing platforms. Though unsuccessful, Google was first to really run after the wearable computing opportunity via Google Glass, and is making an aggressive move into digitizing the home via Google Assistant, its Nest suite of products and FitBit. Accordingly, the Metaverse is likely the only initiative that can unite all of Google’s sprawling investments to date, from edge computing on Stadia, to Project Fi, Google Street View, its extensive purchases of dark fiber, wearables, virtual assistants and more.</p>\n \n ### Apple\n is unlikely to drive or operate the underlying Metaverse. True, it operates the second largest computing platform of the modern era (and by far the most valuable one), as well as the largest game stores on the planet (which also means it pays more to developers than anyone else on earth). In addition, the company is investing heavily into AR devices and “connective tissue” that will aid the Metaverse (e.g. beacons, Apple Watch, Apple Earbuds). However, building an open platform for creation — where everyone can access the full range of user data and device APIs — is antithetical to Apple’s ethos and business strategy. All of which is to say, Apple is more likely to be the dominant way the Western world engages with Metaverse rather than the operator/driver. As with the Internet, this will probably work out pretty well for everyone.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If the Metaverse requires a broad interplay of assets, experiences, and common APIs, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Unity</strong></span> will have a foundational role. This engine is used by more than half of mobile games and is even more widely deployed in real-world rendering/simulation use cases (e.g. architecture, design, engineering) than Unreal. And while director Jon Favreau produced Disney’s <em>The Mandalorian</em> in Unreal, he also produced and shot the photo realistic <em>Lion King</em> in Unity. It also operates one of the largest digital ad networks (a nice side effect of powering 10B daily minutes of mobile entertainment). However, it’s not yet clear what role Unity will have in driving the Metaverse. It doesn’t have a store, a user account system, or a real direct-to-consumer experience. Most of its ancillary (i.e. non-engine or advertising) services have not been widely adopted. In addition, most (though not all) Unity-powered games are relatively simple mobile titles rather than those likely to serve as gateways to the Metaverse. However, its inevitable influence over standards, playtime, and content creation are so large that it’s difficult to imagine it won’t be acquired by and integrated into a major technology player with a wider range of assets and advantages. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In the past, an acquisition of Unity was hard to justify. Even though the company is enormously valuable, any would-be acquirer has to keep Unity fully platform-agnostic in order to preserve its market share, developer support, and influence (e.g. Google couldn’t make Unity exclusive to or best on Android/Chrome exclusive without losing hordes of developers). This doesn’t mean turning Unity into a proprietary engine can’t be strategically smart. The value destroyed by such a decision and the premium required to buy Unity is likely to make such a move prohibitive. But if the goal of a Unity acquisition is to ensure a foundational role in the new Internet, an acquirer instead has an incentive to keep the engine open/available across platforms, and the price can easily become irrelevant.</p>\n \n ### If Epic has a viable path to the Metaverse, Valve must too.\n Valve’s Steam is orders larger than the Epic Games Store in terms of users, revenue, and playtime. It owns several of the most popular, long-running multiplayer games (<em>Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, DotA</em>). The company also has a lengthy history in content and monetization innovation (it was the first to experiment at scale with AAA free-to-play games and with player-to-player marketplaces). Valve has also spent years developing and releasing VR hardware, generates billions in profits each year, and is privately owned by a team of technologists focused on open-source technologies with a disdain for closed ecosystems. At the same time, Valve’s engine, Source, has seen limited adoption, and unlike Epic, it does not seem to be corralled around uniting its capabilities and assets to create the Metaverse.</p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n \n ### Others\n While it's convenient to think of a single lead company or experience ushering in the Metaverse, the process itself will really be led through a Cambrian explosion of different “things” coming together (not that there can’t be a leader or big winner). To this end, there is also a myriad of start-ups trying to build early, proto-Metaverse styled experiences. Ubiquity6, as an example, hopes to use millions of individual content creators to “map” the real world then build smartphone/AR/VR-accessible digital experiences atop these maps. The similarly named Singularity6 is building a virtual world that, unlike <em>Fortnite</em>, is intended to develop into a Metaverse from day one. Other companies, such as Genvid (a portfolio company), are building SDKs that allow anyone to build server-rendered experiences that millions can participate in together using livestreams with light client-side interactivity. While this lacks several of the key attributes of the Metaverse today, such as individual “presence”, it begins amassing enormous volumes of “players” into fully shared virtual environments that aren’t currently possible via cloud or locally-rendered gaming.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Magic Leap seems to believe that by owning the hardware layer, it can be the core driver of the Metaverse (<em>Snow Crash</em> author Neal Stephenson is the company’s Chief Futurist). In fact, most of the FAAMG companies seem to believe that glasses will be a key gateway into our digital future and are collectively investing billions into the form factor. With this in mind, Snapchat, which boasts a large and heavily-engaged social graph and has strongly anchored itself around cameras, glasses, location-based experiences, and digital avatars, could have a key role in the Metaverse (especially if acquired).And for all of its uniqueness, <em>Fortnite</em> isn’t even the only <em>Fortnite</em> — there are several other online “games” that share many of the same attributes, behaviors, and potential. <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Roblox</em>, for example, both boast more than 100MM monthly users (<em>Fortnite</em> probably has fewer) and have also been able to mash up various intellectual properties (such as Marvel and DC). What’s more, these “games” are even more reliant on user-generated content and user-led experiences — there is no underlying game-like goal such as “winning” or “surviving” in <em>Minecraft</em>, the “game” is creation (which isn’t to say that users haven’t created many “games” with game-like goals). In 2019, Roblox says it will have paid out more than $100MM to its game creators around the world (a group that ranges from single “developers” to studios of “10 or 20 people”). The company also notes that it doesn’t even pay these developers directly — unlike the iOS app store — they receive direct payment from users. And in the fall of 2019, Roblox launched its “Developer Marketplace”, <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/12/19/portraits-of-roblox-the-view-from-the-platform/\">which allows developers to monetize not just their games</a>, but also the assets, plug-ins, vehicles, 3D models, terrains, and other items they produce for these games. Meanwhile, many other games, such as <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> (which has an estimated 50MM+ monthly active players), has added socializing-oriented modes (such as a casino) where users can create, operate, or participate in activities purely for the sake of “hanging out”. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"> </p>\n \n ### Building Together\n Ultimately, too much of the Metaverse remains unclear for us to have strong convictions on who will lead it or how they’ll get us there. And in truth, it’s most likely the Metaverse emerges from a network of different platforms, bodies, and technologies working together (however reluctantly) and embracing interoperability. The Internet today is a product of a relatively messy process in which the open (mostly academic) internet developed in parallel with closed (mostly consumer-oriented) services that often looked to “rebuild” or “reset” open standards and protocols.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To this end, it’s hard to imagine any of the major technology companies to being “pushed out” by the Metaverse and/or lacking a major role. Not only will the Metaverse grow the pie by too much, big transitions tend to disrupt when they’re hard to see and incumbents are slow to respond or capital constrained. None of this is true today (which doesn’t mean market share won’t shift, or that some companies, such as Epic, won’t surge to the forefront).</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">At the same time, it’s likely that China’s forked Metaverse will be even more different from (and centrally controlled compared to) the Western one. And here, the tech/media conglomerate Tencent (which also publishes most of the Western games released in China, as well as those of Japan’s Nintendo and Square Enix), is an obvious anchor. The company also owns a reported 40% of Epic Games.</p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n \n ## 1v1v1v1v1v1...\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The visions, technologies, and capabilities I’ve described above still feel like science fiction – even if they come to be, they’re decades away. At the same time, many of the pieces are starting to come together. Thus, the questions are ones of who and why and to which ends. And so, it’s helpful to return to the (lengthy) creation of the World Wide Web. Imagine if instead of being designed by nonprofits and technologists looking to share research files and messages, it was designed to sell ads or collect user data for profits. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This is why it’s so important to Sweeney for his company to lead early efforts to establish the Metaverse — he fears who might instead. “As we build up these platforms toward the Metaverse, if these platforms are locked down and controlled by these proprietary companies, they are going to have far more power over our lives, our private data, and our private interactions with other people than any platform in previous history,” <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/15/epic-games-tim-sweeney-fears-the-metaverse-will-be-a-proprietary-technology/\">Sweeney said </a>in May 2017. Two months later, he was even more explicit: “The amount of power possessed by Google and Facebook. President Eisenhower said it about the military-industrial complex. They pose a grave threat to our democracy.” As “founder and controlling shareholder of Epic”, Sweeney “would never allow” Epic to “share user data…with any other company. We [won’t] share it, sell it, or broker access to it for advertising like so many other companies do.”</p>\n \n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There may not be 100 players, but it’s still a battle royale. </p>\n \n <p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong><em>Matthew Ball (</em></strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ballmatthew\"><strong><em>@ballmatthew</em></strong></a><strong><em>).</em></strong></p>\n ","source":"_posts/work_仕事/Projects/The-MetaVerse.md","raw":"---\ntitle: The MetaVerse\nsticky: 999\ncomments: true\nlang: en_US\ntoc: true\ntocOpen: true\nindexing: true\nhome_posts_tag: false\nimg: >-\n  https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d8e9007bc3d0e18a4c49673/1578751128187-ZAEKVR68CI0D95TT5A6K/CYji2tcttyHWhHGCoHrJ3E.jpg?format=2000w\ntop: false\ndonate: false\ngeolocation: 'Chiba, Japan'\ncopyright: true\nmathjax: false\nshare: true\ntags:\n  - Metaverse\n  - Internet 5.0\n  - Future network\ncategories:\n  - Work_仕事\n  - Projects\ndate: 2021-07-07 19:48:13\nsubtitle:\ndescription:\n---\n\n# The Metaverse: What It Is, Where to Find it, Who Will Build It, & Fortnite\n Original source: https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse\n Video GamingEpic Games/FortniteMetaverse\n <time>Jan 13, 2020</time>\n Written By Matthew Ball\n\n## An Introduction…\n\n Technology frequently produces surprises that nobody predicts. However, the biggest developments are often anticipated decades in advance. In 1945 Vannevar Bush described what he-called the “[Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex)\", a single device that would store all books, records and communications, and mechanically link them together by association. This concept was then used to formulate the idea of “hypertext” (a term coined two decades later), which in turn guided the development of the World Wide Web (developed another two decades later). The “Streaming Wars” have only just begun, yet the first streaming video took place more than 25 years ago. What’s more, many of the attributes of this so-called war have been hypothesized for decades, such as virtually infinite supplies of content, on-demand playback, interactivity, dynamic and personalized ads, and the value of converging content with distribution.\n\n In this sense, the rough outlines of future solutions are often understood and, in a sense, agreed upon well in advance of the technical capacity to produce them. Still, it’s often impossible to predict how they’ll fall into place, which features matter more or less, what sort of governance models or competitive dynamics will drive them, or what new experiences will be produced. By the time Netflix launched its streaming service, much of Hollywood knew that the future of television was online (IP TV had been deployed in the late 1999s). \n \n {% twitter https://twitter.com/ballmatthew/status/1146081701535330305?s=20 %}\n The challenge was timing and [how to package such a service](https://redef.com/original/the-digital-future-of-tv-networks-the-original-series-crunch) (it took another 10 years for Hollywood to accept all of their channels, genres and content needs to be collapsed into a single app/brand). The popularity of video game broadcasting and YouTubers still elude many in the media industry, as does the idea that the best way to monetize content might be to give it away for free and charge for optional $0.99 items of no consequential value. The acquisition of media conglomerate Time Warner by landline internet giant AOL was set in 2000 based on the idea media and tech/distribution needed to converge, but was unwound in 2009 after it failed to produce much benefit. Nine years later, it was then bought by mobile internet giant AT&T under the same premise.\n\n While many technologists imagined some sort of “personal computer”, its attributes and timing were so unpredictable that Microsoft dominated the PC era that began in the 1990s rather than the mainframe domineer IBM. And while Microsoft [clearly foresaw mobile](https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1214924421476929536?s=20), it misread the role of the operating system and too much of the hardware, hence the rise of iOS and Android globally (and Microsoft’s shift from the OS layer to the app/services one). In a similar sense, Steve Jobs’ priorities for computing were always “right”, they were just too early and focused on the wrong device. More broadly, the two most dominant cases of the early Internet were instant messaging and email, and yet the importance of social apps/networks was still unexpected until the late 2000s. And for that matter, all of the prerequisites for building Facebook existed pre-Y2K, but Facebook didn't come along until 2005 – and even then, it was an accident.\n\n Since the late 1970s and early 1980s, many of those in the technology community have imagined a future state of, if not quasi-successor to, the Internet – called the “Metaverse”. And it would revolutionize not just the infrastructure layer of the digital world, but also much of the physical one, as well as all the services and platforms atop them, how they work, and what they sell. Although the full vision for the Metaverse remains hard to define, seemingly fantastical, and decades away, the pieces have started to feel very real. And as always with this sort of change, its arc is as long and unpredictable as its end state is lucrative.\n\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To this end, the Metaverse has become the newest macro-goal for many of the world’s tech giants. As I outlined in<a href=\"https://redef.com/original/fortnite-is-the-future-but-probably-not-for-the-reasons-you-think\"> February of 2019</a>, it is the express goal of Epic Games, maker of the <em>Unreal Engine</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>. It is also <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10111311886191191\">the driver</a> behind Facebook’s purchase of Oculus VR and its newly announced Horizon virtual world/meeting space, among<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/to-control-its-destiny-facebook-bets-big-on-hardware\"> many, many other projects</a>, such as AR glasses and brain-to-machine communications. The tens of billions that will be <a href=\"https://redef.com/original/how-cloud-gaming-will-and-wont-disrupt\">spent on cloud gaming</a> over the next decade, too, is based on the belief that such technologies will underpin our online-offline future.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Ultimately, you’ll find many of the same items in the offices of Big Tech CEOs. However, the most well-worn is likely to be a copy of Neal Stephenson’s <em>Snow Crash</em>, which first described and essentially coined the terms “Metaverse” and “Avatar”. And there are many reasons why.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"> </p>\n \n \n ## CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS THE “METAVERSE”?\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The most common conceptions of the Metaverse stem from science fiction. Here, the Metaverse is typically portrayed as a sort of digital “jacked-in” internet – a manifestation of actual reality, but one based in a virtual (often theme park-like) world, such those portrayed in <em>Ready Player One</em> and <em>The Matrix</em>. And while these sorts of experience are likely to be an <em>aspect</em> of the Metaverse, this conception is limited in the same way movies like <em>Tron </em>portrayed the Internet as a literal digital “information superhighway” of bits. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Just as it was hard to envision in 1982 what the Internet of 2020 would be — and harder still to communicate it to those who had never even “logged” onto it at that time — we don’t really know how to describe the Metaverse. However, we can identify core attributes.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Metaverse, we think, will...</p><ol data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Be persistent</strong> – which is to say, it never “resets” or “pauses” or “ends”, it just continues indefinitely</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Be synchronous and live </strong>– even though pre-scheduled and self-contained events will happen, just as they do in “real life”, the Metaverse will be a living experience that exists consistently for everyone and in real-time</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Be without any cap to concurrent users, while also providing each user with an individual sense of “presence” </strong>– everyone can be a part of the Metaverse and participate in a specific event/place/activity together, at the same time and with individual agency</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Be a fully functioning economy </strong>– individuals and businesses will be able to create, own, invest, sell, and be rewarded for an incredibly wide range of “work” that produces “value” that is recognized by others</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Be an experience that spans </strong>both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Offer unprecedented interoperability </strong>of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences – your “Counter-Strike” gun skin, for example, could also be used to decorate a gun in <em>Fortnite</em>, or be gifted to a friend on/through Facebook. Similarly, a car designed for <em>Rocket League</em> (or even for Porsche’s website) could be brought over to work in <em>Roblox. </em>Today, the digital world basically acts as though it were a mall where every store used its own currency, required proprietary ID cards, had proprietary units of measurement for things like shoes or calories, and different dress codes, etc.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Be populated by “content” and “experiences” <strong>created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors</strong>, some of whom are independent individuals, while others might be informally organized groups or commercially-focused enterprises</p></li></ol><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There are a few other ideas that may be core to the Metaverse, but are not widely agreed upon. One of these concerns is whether participants will have a single consistent digital identity (or “avatar”) that they will use across all experiences. This would have practical value but is probably unlikely as each of the leaders in the “Metaverse era” will still want their own identity systems. Today, for example, there are a few dominant account systems – but none have exhaustive coverage of the web and they often stack atop one another with only limited data sharing/access (e.g. your iPhone is based around an iOS account, then you might log into an app using your Facebook ID, which itself is your Gmail account). </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There is also disagreement on how much interoperability is required for the Metaverse to really be “the Metaverse”, rather than just an evolution of today’s Internet. Many also debate whether a true Metaverse can have a single operator (as is the case in <em>Ready Player One</em>). Some believe the definition (and success) of a Metaverse requires it to be a heavily decentralized platform built mostly upon community-based standards and protocols (like the open web) and an “open source” Metaverse OS or platform (this doesn’t mean there won’t be dominant closed platforms in the Metaverse).</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Another idea relates to the fundamental communications architecture of the Metaverse. This is described in more detail later in the piece, but while today’s Internet is structured around individual servers “talking” to one another on an as-needed basis, some believe the Metaverse needs be “wired” and “operated” around persistent many-to-many connections. But even here, there’s no consensus around exactly how this would work, nor the degree of decentralization required. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It’s also helpful to consider what the Metaverse is often, but incorrectly, likened to. While each of these analogies is likely to be a part of the Metaverse, they aren’t actually the Metaverse. For example, The Metaverse is not…</p><ol data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A “virtual world”</strong> – Virtual worlds and games with AI driven characters have existed for decades, as have those populated with “real” humans in real time. This isn’t a “meta” (Greek for “beyond”) universe, just a synthetic and fictional one designed for a single purpose (a game).</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A “virtual space”</strong> – Digital content experiences like <em>Second Life</em> are often seen as “proto-Metaverses” because they (A) lack game-like goals or skill systems; (B) are virtual hangouts that persist; (C) offer nearly synchronous content updates; and (D) have real humans represented by digital avatars. However, these are not sufficient attributes for the Metaverse. </p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>“Virtual reality”</strong> – VR is a way to experience a virtual world or space. Sense of presence in a digital world doesn’t make a Metaverse. It is like saying you have a thriving city because you can see and walk around it.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A “digital and virtual economy”</strong> – These, too, already exist. Individual games such as <em>World of Warcraft</em> have long had functioning economies where real people trade virtual goods for real money, or perform virtual tasks in exchange for real money. In addition, platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, as well as technologies such as Bitcoin, are based around the hiring of individuals/businesses/computational power to perform virtual and digital tasks. We are already transacting at scale for purely digital items for purely digital activities via purely digital marketplaces.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A “game”</strong> – <em>Fortnite</em> has many elements of the Metaverse. It (A) mashes up IP; (B) has a consistent identity that spans multiple closed platforms; (C) is a gateway to a myriad of experiences, some of which are purely social; (D) compensates creators for creating content, etc. However, as is the case with <em>Ready Player One</em>, it remains too narrow in what it does, how far it extends, and what “work” can occur (at least for now). While the Metaverse may have some game-like goals, include games, and involve gamification, it is not itself a game, nor is it oriented around specific objectives.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A “virtual theme park or Disneyland” </strong>– Not only will the “attractions” be infinite, they will be not be centrally “designed” or programmed like Disneyland, nor will they all be about fun or entertainment. In addition, the distribution of engagement will have a very long tail</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A “new app store” </strong>– No one needs another way to open apps, nor would doing so “in VR” (as an example) unlock/enable the sorts of value supposed by a successor Internet. The Metaverse is substantively different from today’s Internet/mobile models, architecture, and priorities.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A “new UGC platform” - </strong>The Metaverse is not just another YouTube or Facebook-like platform in which countless individuals can “create”, “share”, and “monetize” content, and where the most popular content represents only the tiniest share of overall consumption. The Metaverse will be a place in which proper empires are invested in and built, and where these richly capitalized businesses can fully own a customer, control APIs/data, unit economics, etc. In addition, it’s likely that, as with the web, a dozen or so platforms hold significant shares of user time, experiences, content, etc.</p></li></ol><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>(If you want a simpler way to think about the Metaverse, you can imagine it as the </em>Nightmare Before Christmas<em> – you can walk into any experience or activity, and potentially address almost any of your needs, from a single starting point or world that’s also populated by everyone else you know. This is why hypertext is such a key example. But what’s important is to recognize the Metaverse isn’t a game, a piece of hardware, or an online experience. This is like saying is ‘World of Warcraft’, the iPhone, or Google is the Internet. They are digital worlds, devices, services, websites, etc. The Internet is a wide set of protocols, technology, tubes and languages, plus access devices and content and communication experiences atop them. Metaverse will be too.)</em></p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n \n \n ## CHAPTER 2: WHY DOES THE METAVERSE MATTER?\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Even if the Metaverse falls short of the fantastical visions captured by science fiction authors, it is likely to produce trillions in value as a new computing platform or content medium. But in its full vision, the Metaverse becomes the gateway to most digital experiences, a key component of all physical ones, and the next great labor platform.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The value of being a key participant, if not a driver, of such a system is self-evident – there is no “owner” of the Internet today, but nearly all of the leading Internet companies rank among the 10 most valuable public companies on earth. And if the Metaverse does indeed serve as a functional “successor” to the web — only this time with even greater reach, time spent, and more commercial activity — there’s likely to be even more economic upside. Regardless, the Metaverse should produce the same diversity of opportunity as we saw with the web – new companies, products and services will emerge to manage everything from payment processing to identity verification, hiring, ad delivery, content creation, security, and so forth. This, in turn, will mean many present-day incumbents are likely to fall.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">More broadly, the Metaverse stands to alter how we allocate and monetize modern resources. For centuries, developed economies have transformed as the scarcity of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Rethinking-Economics-Land-Housing-Ryan-Collins/dp/1786991187\">labor and real-estate waxed and waned</a>. Under the Metaverse, would-be laborers who choose to live outside cities will be able to participate in the “high value” economy via virtual labor. As more consumer spending shifts to virtual goods, services, and experiences, we’ll also see further shifts in where we live, the infrastructure that’s built, and who performs which tasks. Consider, for example, “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming\">Gold Farming</a>”. Not long after in-game trade economies emerged, many “players” – often employed by a larger company and typically in lower-income countries — would spend a workday collecting digital resources for sale inside or outside the game. These sales were typically to higher-income players in the West. And while this “labor” is typically menial, repetitive, and limited to a few applications, the diversity and value of this “work” will grow as the Metaverse itself does.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">  </p>\n\n\n ## CHAPTER 3: HOW DOES ONE SIMPLY BUILD A METAVERSE?\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Metaverse will require countless new technologies, protocols, companies, innovations, and discoveries to work. And it won’t directly come into existence; there will be no clean “Before Metaverse” and “After Metaverse”. Instead, it will slowly emerge over time as different products, services, and capabilities integrate and meld together. However, it’s helpful to think of three core elements that need to come into place.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"> <em>(One way I try to think about these three areas is via the Book of Genesis – first, “God” must create the underlying universe (“concurrency infrastructure”), then s/he must define its laws of physics and rules (“standards and protocols”), then s/he must fill it with life (“content”) that’s worthwhile, evolves, and iterates against selection pressures. God, in other words, doesn’t create and design the world as though it were a miniature model, but enables one to grow across a mostly blank tableau etc.)</em></p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n\n ### Concurrency Infrastructure\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">At a foundational level, the technology simply does not yet exist for there to be hundreds, let alone millions of people participating in a shared, synchronous experience. Consider<a href=\"https://redef.com/original/fortnite-is-the-future-but-probably-not-for-the-reasons-you-think\"><em> Fortnite</em>’s 2019 Marshmello concert</a>. An astounding 11MM people experienced the event in real time. However, they did not do so together. In truth, there were more than 100,000 instances of the Marshmello concert, all of which were slightly out of sync and capped at 100 players per instance. Epic can probably do more than this today, but not into several hundred, let alone millions.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Not only does the Metaverse require infrastructure that currently does not exist, the Internet was never designed for anything near this experience. After all, it was designed to share files from one computer to another. As a result, most of the Internet’s underlying systems are oriented around one server talking to one other server or an end-user device. This model continues today. There are billions of people on today’s Facebook, for example, but each user shares an individual connection with the Facebook server, not with any other user.<strong> </strong>Accordingly, when you access content from another user, you’re really just pulling the latest information that Facebook is giving you. The earliest form of pseudo-synchronous programs were text chats, but you’re still just pushing largely static data to a server and pulling the latest information from it when/where/how/as it’s needed. The Internet simply wasn’t designed for persistent (versus continuous) communication, let alone persistent communication that is synchronized in precise real time to countless others. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To operate, the Metaverse requires something more akin to video conferencing and video games. These experiences work because of persistent connections that update each other in real-time and with a degree of accuracy that other programs don’t generally need. However, they tend not to have high levels of concurrency: most video chat programs max out beyond a few people, and once you hit 50, you tend to need to “live stream” a broadcast to your viewers, rather than share a two-way connection. To this end, these experiences neither need to be, nor are they, exactly live. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To this end, part of the reason that the battle royale genre is only recently popular in video games now is because it’s only recently possible to play live with so many other users. Although some games with highest concurrencies have existed for more than twenty years, such as <em>Second Life</em> or <em>Warcraft</em>, they essentially spoofed the experience by “sharding” and splitting users into different “worlds” and servers. <em>Eve Online</em>, for example, can technically have more than 100,000 players “in the same game”, but they are split across different galaxies (i.e. server nodes). As a result, a player only really sees or interacts with a small handful of other players at any one time. In addition, traveling to another galaxy means disconnecting from one server and loading another (which the game is able to narratively “hide” by forcing players to jump to light speed in order to cross the vastness of space). And if/when <em>Eve Online</em> did get to battles involving hundreds of users, the system slowed to a crawl. And this still worked because the gameplay dynamic was based on predominantly large-scale, pre-planned ship-based combat. If it was a “fast-twitch” game such as <em>Rocket League</em> or <em>Call of Duty</em>, these slowdowns would have been unplayable.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">A number of companies are working hard to solve this problem, such as the aptly named Improbable. But this is an enormous computational challenge and one that fights against the underlying design/intent of the Internet. </p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n \n \n ### Standards, Protocols, and their Adoption\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Internet as we experience it today works because of standards and protocols for visual presentation, file loading, communications, graphics, data, and so forth. These include everything from consumer-recognizable .GIFs filetypes to the websocket protocol that underlies almost every form of real-time communication between a browser and other servers on the internet. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Metaverse will require an even broader, more complex, and resilient set of S&amp;Ps. What’s more, the importance of interoperability and live synchronous experiences means we’ll need to prune some existing standards and “standardize” around a smaller set per function. Today, for example, there are a multitude of image file formats: .GIF, .JPEG, .PNG, .BMP, .TIFF, .WEBP, etc. And while the web today is built on open standards, much of it is closed and proprietary. Amazon and Facebook and Google use similar technologies, but they aren’t designed to transition into one another — just as Ford’s wheels aren’t designed to fit a GM chassis. In addition, these companies are incredibly resistant to cross-integrating their systems or sharing their data. Such moves might raise the overall value of the “digital economy”, but also weakens their hyper-valuable network effects and makes it easier for a user to move their digital lives elsewhere.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This will be enormously difficult and take decades. And the more valuable and interoperable the Metaverse is, the harder it will be to establish industry-wide consensus around topics such as data security, data persistence, forward compatible code evolution, and transactions. In addition, the Metaverse will need altogether new rules for censorship, control of communications, regulatory enforcement, tax reporting, the prevention of online radicalization, and many more challenges that we’re still struggling with today.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">While the establishments of standards usually involve actual meetings, negotiations, and debates, the standards for the Metaverse won’t be established upfront. The standard process is much messier and organic, with meetings and opinions changing on an ad hoc basis. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To use a meta analogy for the Metaverse, consider <em>SimCity</em>. In ideal circumstances, the “Mayor” (i.e. player) would first design their mega-metropolis, then build from day one to this final vision. But in the game, as with real life, you can’t just “build” a 10MM person city. You start with a small town and optimize for it first (e.g. where the roads are, schools are, utility capacity, etc.). As it grows, you build around this town, occasionally but judiciously tearing down and replacing “old” sections, sometimes only if/when a problem (insufficient supply of power) or disaster hits (a fire). But unlike <em>SimCity</em>, there will be many mayors, not one — and their desires and incentives will often conflict. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We don’t know exactly what the Metaverse will need, let alone which existing standards will transfer over, how, to what effects, when, or through which applications and groups. As a result, it’s important to consider <em>how</em> the Metaverse emerges, not just around which technological standard.</p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n \n \n ### The ‘On-Ramp’ Experience\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Just as the standards for the Metaverse can’t simply be “declared”, consumers and businesses won’t embrace a would-be proto-Metaverse simply because it’s available.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Consider the real world. Just making a mall capable of fitting a hundred thousand people or a hundred shops doesn’t mean it attracts a single consumer or brand. “Town squares” emerge organically around existing infrastructure and behaviors, to fulfill existing civilian and commercial needs. Ultimately, any place of congregation — be it a bar, basement, park, museum or merry go-round — is attended because of who or what is already there, not because it’s a place in of itself.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The same is true of digital experiences. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, didn’t work because it announced it would be a “social network”, but because it emerged first as a campus hot-or-not, then became a digital yearbook turned photo-sharing and messaging service. As with Facebook, the Metaverse needs to be “populated”, rather than just “populable”, and this population must then fill in this digital world with things to do and content to consume.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This is why considering <em>Fortnite</em> as video game or interactive experience is to think too small and too immediately. <em>Fortnite</em> began as a game, but it quickly evolved into a social square. Its players aren’t logging in to “play”, per se, but to be with their virtual and real-world friends. Teenagers in the 1970s to 2010s would come home and spend three hours talking on the phone. Now they talk to their friends on <em>Fortnite</em>, but not about <em>Fortnite</em>. Instead, they talk about school, movies, sports, news, boys, girls and more. After all, <em>Fortnite</em> doesn’t have a story or IP – the plot is what happens on it and who is there.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Furthermore, <em>Fortnite</em> is rapidly becoming a medium through which other brands, IP, and stories express themselves. Most famously, this includes last year’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBsCzN-jfvA\">live Marshmello concert</a>. However, such examples have rapidly expanded since. In December 2019, <em>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</em> released a clip of the hotly-anticipated film exclusively in <em>Fortnite</em> as part of a larger, in-game <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8M72aZsI2E\">audience-interactive</a> event that included a live interview with director J.J. Abrams. What’s more, this event was <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/12/20/21031513/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-fortnite-opening-crawl-palpatines-message\">explicitly referenced in the opening moments</a> of the film. The band Weezer produced a bespoke island where fans could get an <a href=\"https://www.stereogum.com/2034103/weezer-the-black-album-fortnite-weezer-island/news/\">exclusive first listen</a> to their new album (while dancing with other “players”. <em>Fortnite</em> has also produced several themed “limited-time modes” involving the likes of <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/5/22/18634329/fortnite-jumpman-air-jordan-skins-hang-time-nike\">Nike’s Air Jordan</a> and Lionsgate’s <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/5/16/18627662/fortnite-john-wick-ltm-skin-mode-tokens-loot-pc-ps4-xbox-one-nintendo-switch\">John Wick film series</a>. In some cases, these “LTMs” transform part of <em>Fortnite</em>’s map into a mini-virtual world that, when entered, changes the aesthetics, items and playstyle of the game to resemble another. This has included the universe of the game Borderlands, Batman’s hometown of Gotham, and the old west.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To this end, <em>Fortnite</em> is one of the few places where the IP of Marvel and DC intersects. You can literally wear a Marvel character’s costume inside Gotham City, while interacting with those wearing legally licensed NFL uniforms. This sort of thing hasn’t really happened before. But it will be critical to the Metaverse.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">More broadly, a whole sub-economy on <em>Fortnite</em> has emerged where “players” can build (and monetize) their own content. This can be as small as digital outfits (“skins”) or dances (“emotes”). However, it has rapidly expanded into creating all new games and experience using <em>Fortnite</em>’s engine, assets, and aesthetics. This includes everything from simple treasure hunts, to immersive mash-ups of the <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/6/20699692/fortnite-battle-royale-creative-mode-epic-games\">Brothers Grimm with parkour culture</a>, to a <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/some-people-made-an-entire-sci-fi-game-inside-of-fortni-1840069759\">10-hour sci-fi story that spans multiple dimensions and timelines</a>. In fact, <em>Fortnite</em>’s Creative Mode, already feels like a proto-Metaverse. Here, a player loads their avatar — one specific to them and which is used in all <em>Fortnite</em>-related experiences — and lands in a game-like lobby and can choose from thousands of “doors” (i.e. space-time rifts) that send them to one of thousands of different worlds with up to 99 other players.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This speaks to the longer term-vision for the game, one that creative director Donald Mustard is increasingly clear about. <em>Fortnite</em> isn’t the Metaverse, but nothing is closer to the Metaverse today in spirit and it is clear how the “game” might eventually underpin one.</p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n \n \n ### Epic Games’ Epic Game Plan\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The best example of <em>Fortnite</em>’s potential is demonstrated by its ability to persuade many supposed competitors into cooperation (or early “interoperability”) with one another. Today, <em>Fortnite</em> works across each major entertainment platform – iOS, Android, PlayStation, Nintendo, PC, Xbox — allowing full cross-play that spans multiple identity/account systems, payment methods, social graphs, and typically closed ecosystems. For years, this was heavily resisted by the major gaming platforms as they believed that enabling such an experience would undermine their network effects and reduce the need to buy their proprietary hardware. As a result, a friend with <em>Call of Duty</em> on PlayStation could never play with their friend with <em>Call of Duty</em> on Xbox, even though both Sony and Microsoft knew they wanted to. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Similarly, it’s unusual for IP owners to allow their characters and stories to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ballmatthew/status/1179444988326760448?s=20\">intermingled with other IP</a>. This does happen from time to time (e.g. there are several Marvel v DC comic book crossovers and video games). But it’s particularly rare to see it crossed over in an experience they don’t control editorially, let alone one based around unpredictability (not even the creative team behind <em>Fortnite</em> knows what it will do in 2021) and with such a wide range of IP.</p>\n \n   {% twitter https://twitter.com/juliey4/status/1205393085145874433 %}\n\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This organic evolution can’t be overemphasized. If you “declared” your intent to start a Metaverse, these parties would never embrace interoperability or entrust their IP. But <em>Fortnite</em> has become so popular and so unique that most counterparties have no choice but to participate – in fact, they’re probably desperate to integrate into the “game” – just as P&amp;G can’t say “eh, Facebook isn’t for us”. <em>Fortnite</em> is too valuable a platform.</p>\n\n  {% twitter https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1210291961904730114 %}\n\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">At the same time, Epic is bringing far more than a plausible on-ramp to its efforts to build the Metaverse. In addition to operating <em>Fortnite</em> — which was in theory a side project — Epic Games also owns the second largest independent gaming engine, Unreal. This means thousands of games already operate on its “stack” of tools and software (to simplify things), making it easier to share assets, integrate experiences, and share user profiles. Over time, the sophistication of Epic’s gaming engine has grown so significant it now powers a variety of traditional media experiences. Disney’s <em>The Mandalorian</em> was shot and fully rendered in Unreal, with director Jon Favreau able to literally enter its digital sets to frame a shot and position characters. If Disney so chooses, audiences could freely investigate much of these sets — most of the environment and assets already exist. And outside film and TV, Unreal is increasingly being used for live events, too: Unreal powers Fox Sports’s NASCAR set, for example.</p>\n \n ### Real-Time In-Camera VFX for Next-Gen Filmmaking - Video (2 minutes)\n  Real-time technology is transforming the art of filmmaking, with next-generation virtual production tools coming to Unreal Engine. At SIGGRAPH, Epic Games partnered with Lux Machina, Magnopus, Profile Studios, Quixel, ARRI, and DP Matt Workman to demonstrate how LED walls can provide not only virtual environments but also lighting for real-world elements, so the entire scene can be captured in camera in a single pass.\n {% youtuber video bErPsq5kPzE %}\n  allowfullscreen: 1,\n  autoplay: 0,\n  hl: en,\n  cc_lang_pref: en,\n  cc_load_policy: 1,\n  color: white,\n  controls: 1,\n  disablekb: 0,\n  enablejsapi: 1,\n  fs: 0,\n  iv_load_policy: 3,\n  loop: 0,\n  modestbranding: 1,\n  playsinline: 0,\n  privacy_mode: yes,\n  rel: 0,\n  showinfo: 0,\n  origin: blog.richiebartlett.com,\n  widget_referrer: blog.richiebartlett.com\n{% endyoutuber %}\n \n\n\n\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Still<strong>,</strong> the Metaverse requires everyone be able to create and contribute ‘content’ and ‘experiences,’ not just well-staffed corporations and technically skilled individuals trying to make games or movies. To this end, Epic acquired the company <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/twinmotion\">Twinmotion</a> in April of last year. The company was/is focused not on VFX engineers or game designers, but on offering intuitive, icon-based software that enables “architecture, construction, urban planning and landscaping professionals” to produce realistic, immersive digital environments based in Unreal “in seconds”. According to Epic Games Founder/CEO Tim Sweeney, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHemFyNcTZo\">this means that there are now three ways to create in Unreal</a>: the standard “coding” engine itself, the more simplified and “visual” Twinmotion, and <em>Fortnite</em> Creative Mode for those with no experience in programming and design. Over time, each option is likely to become more capable, easier to use and integrated.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Another increasingly important part of Epic’s offering is its “Online Services” suite, which allows developers to immediately support cross-play across Sony + Microsoft + Nintendo + PC + iOS + Android and leverage Epic’s account systems/social graph (which has 1.6B player connections). This itself isn’t that unique — Microsoft spent $400MM acquiring PlayFab and millions more to support Xbox Live, while Amazon has bought both GameSparks and GameLift in order to sell services to game developers that need lots of servers and tools for their online games to work. Valve doesn’t offer server infrastructure, but its Steamworks solution gives developers match-making and account services for free — but only for the Steam Store, Valve’s core business. This reveals Epic’s play with Online Services. Unlike today’s market leaders, Epic doesn’t charge. It’s also available free to any engine, any platform, and any game. And it operates at the scale of <em>Fortnite</em>’s player network, allowing any title to leverage the world’s largest player graph to kickstart their userbases. There is obviously value in such an offering, but to Epic, it is “more valuable if free” as it extends the company’s already enormous social graph, makes it much easier for more games to “talk to” one another, and enables players to more seamlessly jump from experience to experience. All of this, too, diminishes Epic’s reliance upon <em>Fortnite</em> when it comes to building the Metaverse. And while Epic Online Services are still in private beta, the company has suggested it will be publicly available in Q2 2020 and should support “hundreds or thousands of games in 2020”. Note, too, that this all reduces Epic’s reliance on <em>Fortnite</em> in its long-term efforts to build the Metaverse.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Epic also operates one of the largest (albeit a still small) digital game store – which means players already access a wide variety of digital content and experiences through Epic. Few consumers were clamoring for greater fragmentation of digital content, and most were reasonably happy with market leader Steam. However, Epic Games Founder/CEO Tim Sweeney has been vocal about the fact that today’s standard 30% commissions for digital content sales (e.g. iOS or Amazon or Google Play) are not just usurious, they prevent the creation of a real digital world economy. Just imagine, for example, if credit card fees weren’t 0.5-2.5% but up to 60-20x as much; whole sectors of the physical economy wouldn’t be able to operate (such as a coffee shop or grocery store). To this end, Epic charges only 12% (which includes the 5% Unreal licensing fee, too, making it only 7% for many customers). Notably, rumors persist that Sweeney had fought for even lower fees but settled with his board at 12% – a sum he himself admits doesn’t always cover operating costs. This doesn’t mean there isn’t an overall business here – and operating a storefront will doubtlessly help build the Metaverse – but Sweeney’s efforts seem much broader. He openly implores Google and Apple, which generate several thousand times the revenue of Epic’s fledgling store, to match Epic’s rates.</p>\n \n   {% twitter https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1216089159946948620 %}\n\n ## CHAPTER 4: WHO ELSE CAN BUILD THE METAVERSE?\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Although the Metaverse has the potential to succeed the Internet as a computing platform, its underlying development process is likely to share little in common with its antecedent. The Internet came from public research universities and US government programs. This was in part because few in private business understood the commercial potential of a World Wide Web, but it was also true that these groups were essentially the only entities with the computational talent, resources, and ambitions to build it. None of this is true when it comes to the Metaverse.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Not only is private industry fully aware of the potential of the Metaverse, it probably has the most aggressive conviction in this future, not to mention the most cash (at least when it comes from a willingness to fund Metaverse R&amp;D), the best engineering talent, and greatest desire for conquest. The major tech companies don’t just want to lead the Metaverse, they want to own and define it. There will still be a large role for open-source projects with non-corporate ethos — and they will attract some of the most interesting creative talent in the Metaverse — but there are only a few likely leaders in the early Metaverse. And you’ll recognize each one.</p>\n \n ### Microsoft is a good example. \n The company has hundreds of millions of federated user identities via Office 365 and LinkedIn, is the second largest cloud vendor in the world, has an extensive suite of work-related software and services that span all systems/platforms/infrastructure, clear technical experience in massive shared online content/operations, and a set of potential gateway experiences via Minecraft, Xbox + Xbox Live, and HoloLens. To this end, the Metaverse offers Microsoft the opportunity to reclaim the OS/hardware leadership it ceded during the handoff from PC to mobile. But more importantly, CEO Satya Nadella understands Microsoft, at a minimum, needs to be wherever work happens. Having successfully adapted from enterprise to consumer, PC to mobile, and offline to online, all while maintaining a dominant role in the “work” economy, it’s hard to envision Microsoft won’t be a primary driver in the virtualized future of labor and information processing.</p>\n \n ### Although Facebook\n CEO Mark Zuckerberg has not explicitly declared his intent to develop and own the Metaverse, his obsession with it seems <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/to-control-its-destiny-facebook-bets-big-on-hardware\">fairly clear</a>. And this is smart. More than any other company, Facebook has the most to lose from the Metaverse as it will build an even larger and more capable social graph and represent both a new computing platform and a new engagement platform. At the same time, the Metaverse also allows Facebook to extend its reach up and down the stack. Despite several efforts to build a smartphone OS and deploy consumer hardware, Facebook remains the one FAAMG company stuck purely at the app/service layer. Through the Metaverse, Facebook could become the next Android or iOS/iPhone (hence Oculus), not to mention a virtual goods version of Amazon.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Facebook’s Metaverse advantages are immense. It has more users, daily usage and user-generated content created each day than any other platform on earth, as well as the second largest share of digital ad spend, billions in cash, thousands of world-class engineers, and conviction from a founder with majority voting rights. Its Metaverse-oriented assets are also growing rapidly and now include patents for semiconductor and brain-to-machine computing interfaces. At the same time, Facebook has a very troubled track record as a platform for where third-party developers/companies can build sustainable businesses, as a ringleader in a consortium (e.g. Libra), and in managing user data/trust. </p>\n \n ### Amazon\n is interesting in a few regards. Most obviously, it will always want to be the primary place in which we buy ‘stuff.’ Whether that’s bought inside a game engine, a virtual world, or web browser is irrelevant (it already sells inside Twitch). In addition, the company already has hundreds of millions of credit cards, the largest share of ecommerce globally (ex-China), is the world’s largest cloud vendor, operates numerous different consumer media experiences (video, music, ebooks, audiobooks, video game broadcasting, etc.) and third-party commerce platforms (e.g. Fulfilled by Amazon, Amazon Channels), is building what they hope will be the first major gaming/rendering engine purpose-designed for the cloud computing era, reportedly working on AR glasses, and is the leader in in-home/office digital assistants. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">More importantly, Founder/CEO Jeff Bezos feels very strongly about underlying infrastructure plays. The web, for example, runs on AWS (Amazon’s best business). 80% of its revenue is actually via “Fulfilled by Amazon,” where the company sells, packages, and delivers products sold by other businesses, instead of Amazon buying and then selling the inventory directly (like most retailers). And while the goal of Elon Musk’s private aerospace company, SpaceX, is to colonize mars, Bezos has been clear his goal with Blue Origin is to facilitate the buildout of space infrastructure similar to early web protocols and his AWS, so that “we could build gigantic chip factories in space and just send little bits down.” To this end, Amazon is likely to be more supportive of a truly “open” Metaverse than any other FAAMG company — it doesn’t need to control the UX or ID because it benefits from enormous increases in back-end infrastructure usage and digital transactions.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Internet is a mine of data and the Metaverse will have both more data and perhaps greater returns on it than today’s web. And no one monetizes this data better at global scale than <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Google</strong></span>. In addition, the company is not just the market leader in indexing both the digital and physical world (nearly 10,000 employees contribute to its mapping initiatives), but it is also the most successful digital software and services company outside of China. It also operates the most used operating system on earth (Android), as well as the most open of the major consumer computing platforms. Though unsuccessful, Google was first to really run after the wearable computing opportunity via Google Glass, and is making an aggressive move into digitizing the home via Google Assistant, its Nest suite of products and FitBit. Accordingly, the Metaverse is likely the only initiative that can unite all of Google’s sprawling investments to date, from edge computing on Stadia, to Project Fi, Google Street View, its extensive purchases of dark fiber, wearables, virtual assistants and more.</p>\n \n ### Apple\n is unlikely to drive or operate the underlying Metaverse. True, it operates the second largest computing platform of the modern era (and by far the most valuable one), as well as the largest game stores on the planet (which also means it pays more to developers than anyone else on earth). In addition, the company is investing heavily into AR devices and “connective tissue” that will aid the Metaverse (e.g. beacons, Apple Watch, Apple Earbuds). However, building an open platform for creation — where everyone can access the full range of user data and device APIs — is antithetical to Apple’s ethos and business strategy. All of which is to say, Apple is more likely to be the dominant way the Western world engages with Metaverse rather than the operator/driver. As with the Internet, this will probably work out pretty well for everyone.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If the Metaverse requires a broad interplay of assets, experiences, and common APIs, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Unity</strong></span> will have a foundational role. This engine is used by more than half of mobile games and is even more widely deployed in real-world rendering/simulation use cases (e.g. architecture, design, engineering) than Unreal. And while director Jon Favreau produced Disney’s <em>The Mandalorian</em> in Unreal, he also produced and shot the photo realistic <em>Lion King</em> in Unity. It also operates one of the largest digital ad networks (a nice side effect of powering 10B daily minutes of mobile entertainment). However, it’s not yet clear what role Unity will have in driving the Metaverse. It doesn’t have a store, a user account system, or a real direct-to-consumer experience. Most of its ancillary (i.e. non-engine or advertising) services have not been widely adopted. In addition, most (though not all) Unity-powered games are relatively simple mobile titles rather than those likely to serve as gateways to the Metaverse. However, its inevitable influence over standards, playtime, and content creation are so large that it’s difficult to imagine it won’t be acquired by and integrated into a major technology player with a wider range of assets and advantages. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In the past, an acquisition of Unity was hard to justify. Even though the company is enormously valuable, any would-be acquirer has to keep Unity fully platform-agnostic in order to preserve its market share, developer support, and influence (e.g. Google couldn’t make Unity exclusive to or best on Android/Chrome exclusive without losing hordes of developers). This doesn’t mean turning Unity into a proprietary engine can’t be strategically smart. The value destroyed by such a decision and the premium required to buy Unity is likely to make such a move prohibitive. But if the goal of a Unity acquisition is to ensure a foundational role in the new Internet, an acquirer instead has an incentive to keep the engine open/available across platforms, and the price can easily become irrelevant.</p>\n \n ### If Epic has a viable path to the Metaverse, Valve must too.\n Valve’s Steam is orders larger than the Epic Games Store in terms of users, revenue, and playtime. It owns several of the most popular, long-running multiplayer games (<em>Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, DotA</em>). The company also has a lengthy history in content and monetization innovation (it was the first to experiment at scale with AAA free-to-play games and with player-to-player marketplaces). Valve has also spent years developing and releasing VR hardware, generates billions in profits each year, and is privately owned by a team of technologists focused on open-source technologies with a disdain for closed ecosystems. At the same time, Valve’s engine, Source, has seen limited adoption, and unlike Epic, it does not seem to be corralled around uniting its capabilities and assets to create the Metaverse.</p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n \n ### Others\n While it's convenient to think of a single lead company or experience ushering in the Metaverse, the process itself will really be led through a Cambrian explosion of different “things” coming together (not that there can’t be a leader or big winner). To this end, there is also a myriad of start-ups trying to build early, proto-Metaverse styled experiences. Ubiquity6, as an example, hopes to use millions of individual content creators to “map” the real world then build smartphone/AR/VR-accessible digital experiences atop these maps. The similarly named Singularity6 is building a virtual world that, unlike <em>Fortnite</em>, is intended to develop into a Metaverse from day one. Other companies, such as Genvid (a portfolio company), are building SDKs that allow anyone to build server-rendered experiences that millions can participate in together using livestreams with light client-side interactivity. While this lacks several of the key attributes of the Metaverse today, such as individual “presence”, it begins amassing enormous volumes of “players” into fully shared virtual environments that aren’t currently possible via cloud or locally-rendered gaming.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Magic Leap seems to believe that by owning the hardware layer, it can be the core driver of the Metaverse (<em>Snow Crash</em> author Neal Stephenson is the company’s Chief Futurist). In fact, most of the FAAMG companies seem to believe that glasses will be a key gateway into our digital future and are collectively investing billions into the form factor. With this in mind, Snapchat, which boasts a large and heavily-engaged social graph and has strongly anchored itself around cameras, glasses, location-based experiences, and digital avatars, could have a key role in the Metaverse (especially if acquired).And for all of its uniqueness, <em>Fortnite</em> isn’t even the only <em>Fortnite</em> — there are several other online “games” that share many of the same attributes, behaviors, and potential. <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Roblox</em>, for example, both boast more than 100MM monthly users (<em>Fortnite</em> probably has fewer) and have also been able to mash up various intellectual properties (such as Marvel and DC). What’s more, these “games” are even more reliant on user-generated content and user-led experiences — there is no underlying game-like goal such as “winning” or “surviving” in <em>Minecraft</em>, the “game” is creation (which isn’t to say that users haven’t created many “games” with game-like goals). In 2019, Roblox says it will have paid out more than $100MM to its game creators around the world (a group that ranges from single “developers” to studios of “10 or 20 people”). The company also notes that it doesn’t even pay these developers directly — unlike the iOS app store — they receive direct payment from users. And in the fall of 2019, Roblox launched its “Developer Marketplace”, <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/12/19/portraits-of-roblox-the-view-from-the-platform/\">which allows developers to monetize not just their games</a>, but also the assets, plug-ins, vehicles, 3D models, terrains, and other items they produce for these games. Meanwhile, many other games, such as <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> (which has an estimated 50MM+ monthly active players), has added socializing-oriented modes (such as a casino) where users can create, operate, or participate in activities purely for the sake of “hanging out”. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"> </p>\n \n ### Building Together\n Ultimately, too much of the Metaverse remains unclear for us to have strong convictions on who will lead it or how they’ll get us there. And in truth, it’s most likely the Metaverse emerges from a network of different platforms, bodies, and technologies working together (however reluctantly) and embracing interoperability. The Internet today is a product of a relatively messy process in which the open (mostly academic) internet developed in parallel with closed (mostly consumer-oriented) services that often looked to “rebuild” or “reset” open standards and protocols.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To this end, it’s hard to imagine any of the major technology companies to being “pushed out” by the Metaverse and/or lacking a major role. Not only will the Metaverse grow the pie by too much, big transitions tend to disrupt when they’re hard to see and incumbents are slow to respond or capital constrained. None of this is true today (which doesn’t mean market share won’t shift, or that some companies, such as Epic, won’t surge to the forefront).</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">At the same time, it’s likely that China’s forked Metaverse will be even more different from (and centrally controlled compared to) the Western one. And here, the tech/media conglomerate Tencent (which also publishes most of the Western games released in China, as well as those of Japan’s Nintendo and Square Enix), is an obvious anchor. The company also owns a reported 40% of Epic Games.</p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n \n ## 1v1v1v1v1v1...\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The visions, technologies, and capabilities I’ve described above still feel like science fiction – even if they come to be, they’re decades away. At the same time, many of the pieces are starting to come together. Thus, the questions are ones of who and why and to which ends. And so, it’s helpful to return to the (lengthy) creation of the World Wide Web. Imagine if instead of being designed by nonprofits and technologists looking to share research files and messages, it was designed to sell ads or collect user data for profits. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This is why it’s so important to Sweeney for his company to lead early efforts to establish the Metaverse — he fears who might instead. “As we build up these platforms toward the Metaverse, if these platforms are locked down and controlled by these proprietary companies, they are going to have far more power over our lives, our private data, and our private interactions with other people than any platform in previous history,” <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/15/epic-games-tim-sweeney-fears-the-metaverse-will-be-a-proprietary-technology/\">Sweeney said </a>in May 2017. Two months later, he was even more explicit: “The amount of power possessed by Google and Facebook. President Eisenhower said it about the military-industrial complex. They pose a grave threat to our democracy.” As “founder and controlling shareholder of Epic”, Sweeney “would never allow” Epic to “share user data…with any other company. We [won’t] share it, sell it, or broker access to it for advertising like so many other companies do.”</p>\n \n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There may not be 100 players, but it’s still a battle royale. </p>\n \n <p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong><em>Matthew Ball (</em></strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ballmatthew\"><strong><em>@ballmatthew</em></strong></a><strong><em>).</em></strong></p>\n ","slug":"work_仕事/Projects/The-MetaVerse","published":1,"updated":"2022-04-12T18:53:07.325Z","_id":"cl1wm5alb004kisuycmkn6vko","layout":"post","photos":[],"link":""},{"title":"Researching Blog Design","sticky":4,"comments":1,"lang":"en_US","toc":true,"tocOpen":true,"indexing":true,"top":true,"donate":false,"geolocation":"Chiba, Japan","copyright":true,"mathjax":false,"share":true,"description":"Learning best Blog designs for 2021","img":"/2021/0603/Work_仕事/Projects/Researching-Blog-Design/AdobeStock_386084304.jpeg","date":"2021-06-03T10:56:57.000Z","_content":"\n## Relearning the basics in Web design\n While I haven't really been doing much web design over the last few years, I have learned that advancements in JS/CSS have made things previously not easy now trivial.

UX is more entrenched in behavioral pyschology than graphics design. Whereas a UI designer is more like a coder that is concerned with the interface elements. The UX designer would instruct the UI designer how best to engage the customers/users. In larger organizations, the roles around a website design are divided up among at least six different roles. However, in a startup (like what I do), I'm often that one person that does it all. However, I'm likely to outsource the visual/graphics design.\n\n### UX & UI\n{% gallery stretch, 2 %}\n![UX vs UI](./Researching-Blog-Design/UXvsUI.png)\n![Psychology vs Interface](./Researching-Blog-Design/ux-ui-diagram-corrected.png)\n![Roles: UX designer vs UI designer](./Researching-Blog-Design/UX-designer-Inforgraphic.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n### Video course (4 hours)\n{% youtuber video uL2ZB7XXIgg %} \n  allowfullscreen: 1,\n  autoplay: 0,\n  hl: en,\n  cc_lang_pref: en,\n  cc_load_policy: 1,\n  color: white,\n  controls: 1,\n  disablekb: 0,\n  enablejsapi: 1,\n  fs: 0,\n  iv_load_policy: 3,\n  loop: 0,\n  modestbranding: 1,\n  playsinline: 0,\n  privacy_mode: yes,\n  rel: 0,\n  showinfo: 0,\n  origin: blog.richiebartlett.com,\n  widget_referrer: blog.richiebartlett.com\n{% endyoutuber %}\n\n\n### Customers & Sales\n{% gallery stretch, 3 %}\n![Customer Journey](./Researching-Blog-Design/Customer_Journey.png)\n![Sales Funnel](./Researching-Blog-Design/UX-Design_Sales_Funnel.png)\n![3 Sales Funnel phases](./Researching-Blog-Design/3sales_funnel_phases.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n### Sales Funnel Stages\n{% gallery stretch, 3 %}\n![Sales stages](./Researching-Blog-Design/Sales_Funnel_stages.png)\n![Market Sophistication](./Researching-Blog-Design/Market_Sophistication.png)\n![Market Sophistication stages ](./Researching-Blog-Design/Stages_of_market_sophistication.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n### Lead Generation Funnel\n{% gallery stretch, 3 %}\n![Lead Funnels](./Researching-Blog-Design/Lead_Funnels.png)\n![Lead generation funnel](./Researching-Blog-Design/Lead_generation_funnel.png)\n![Digital Product funnel](./Researching-Blog-Design/Digital_Prod_funnel.png)\n![Digital Product funnel stages](./Researching-Blog-Design/Digital_Prod_funnel_stages.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n### Principles of Influence\n{% gallery stretch, 2 %}\n![Influence Principles](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence_Principles.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n### Age based Influence\n{% gallery stretch, 3 %}\n![Age Influence](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence-Age.png)\n![Age Influence Triggers: Gen X](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence-Age_Triggers_Gen-X.png)\n![Age Influence Triggers: Baby Boomers](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence-Age_Triggers_Boomers.png)\n![Age Influence Triggers: Millennials](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence-Age_Triggers_Millennials.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n### Gender based Influence\n{% gallery stretch, 3 %}\n![Gender Influence](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence-Gender.png)\n![Gender Influence: Male](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence-Gender_Male.png)\n![Gender Influence: Female](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence-Gender_Female.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n### Interest based Marketing\nHere are some tools to use to determine the demographics available on Facebook / Instagram and elsewhere.\n- [FaceBook Insights](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/audience-insights)\n- [Instagram Insights](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/788388387972460)\n- [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/)\n- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/)\n\n{% gallery stretch, 2 %}\n![Interest Marketing](./Researching-Blog-Design/Interest_Marketing.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n\n\n## Typography\n As I have read a lot of books and online sites, I've observed a number of \"unwritten rules\" around the way information is presented. I've seen what I found easy to read versus simple content that is difficult to parse due to poor design choices. That said, I'm no expert at Lettering nor Typography. So, I've watched this \"crash course\" on the topic. I'm not concerned about Lettering so much as I'm not looking to display hand-written work. \n\n### Video (2 hours)\n{% youtuber video agbh1wbfJt8 %}\n  allowfullscreen: 1,\n  autoplay: 0,\n  hl: en,\n  cc_lang_pref: en,\n  cc_load_policy: 1,\n  color: white,\n  controls: 1,\n  disablekb: 0,\n  enablejsapi: 1,\n  fs: 0,\n  iv_load_policy: 3,\n  loop: 0,\n  modestbranding: 1,\n  playsinline: 0,\n  privacy_mode: yes,\n  rel: 0,\n  showinfo: 0,\n  origin: blog.richiebartlett.com,\n  widget_referrer: blog.richiebartlett.com\n{% endyoutuber %}\n\n### Psychology\n {% gallery stretch, 2 %}\n ![Psychology Behind Type](./Researching-Blog-Design/Psychology_Behind_Type.jpg)\n {% endgallery %}\n [Psychology of Font Choices](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/psychology-of-fonts-infographic/)\n\n### Design resources to review:\n- [Archetypeapp.com](https://Archetypeapp.com)\n- [DesignSystems.com](https://DesignSystems.com)\n- [Material.io](https://Material.io)\n\n### Online Icon repositories\n- [FeatherIcons.com](https://FeatherIcons.com)\n- [FlatIcon.com](https://FlatIcon.com)\n- [IconFinder.com](https://IconFinder.com)\n- [TheNounProject.com](https://TheNounProject.com)\n \n\n\n### Improve your designs with these simple tricks to picking fonts\n Picking fonts can be a frustrating affair.

Each color has positive and negative connotations, and you want to be careful of the messages you're sending. Watch this video all about the psychology of color before getting started on your own marketing graphics: https://www.visme.co\n This is why marketing color psychology is so essential to understand. Knowing how colors work together and what the different colors mean is key to creating beautiful designs.\n\n _NOTE_: Different cultures and languages have some very different color associations. Not everyone thinks of a certain color as associated with the same meanings. So try to learn about these color associations from different groups, by reading up on color.\n\n#### Video (15 minutes)\n{% youtuber video x0smq5ljlf4 %}\n  allowfullscreen: 1,\n  autoplay: 0,\n  hl: en,\n  cc_lang_pref: en,\n  cc_load_policy: 1,\n  color: white,\n  controls: 1,\n  disablekb: 0,\n  enablejsapi: 1,\n  fs: 0,\n  iv_load_policy: 3,\n  loop: 0,\n  modestbranding: 1,\n  playsinline: 0,\n  privacy_mode: yes,\n  rel: 0,\n  showinfo: 0,\n  origin: blog.richiebartlett.com,\n  widget_referrer: blog.richiebartlett.com\n{% endyoutuber %}\n\n\n\n\n\n## CSS\n Cascading Sheet Styles\n\n Along with the video tutorials below, here's a list of excellent CSS / Web-Dev resources:\n - Modern CSS by Stephanie Eckles https://moderncss.dev/\n - Webbed Briefs https://briefs.video/ \n - Sara Soueidan https://www.sarasoueidan.com/\n - The CSS Podcast https://thecsspodcast.libsyn.com/\n - Una's channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJnidRIv3o1hf_YBWjKFljg\n - Live SCSS/SASS to CSS compiler https://www.sassmeister.com/\n\n\n\n### Writing responsive CSS the wrong way?\n I know sometimes it's because we have a design file that's only a layout as a desktop layout, or because it's just how we're used to working since we're on a desktop, but I'm writing mobile-first CSS not only results in less code, I also think it's a lot easier.\n\n#### Video (14 minutes)\n{% youtuber video 0ohtVzCSHqs %}\n  allowfullscreen: 1,\n  autoplay: 0,\n  hl: en,\n  cc_lang_pref: en,\n  cc_load_policy: 1,\n  color: white,\n  controls: 1,\n  disablekb: 0,\n  enablejsapi: 1,\n  fs: 0,\n  iv_load_policy: 3,\n  loop: 0,\n  modestbranding: 1,\n  playsinline: 0,\n  privacy_mode: yes,\n  rel: 0,\n  showinfo: 0,\n  origin: blog.richiebartlett.com,\n  widget_referrer: blog.richiebartlett.com\n{% endyoutuber %}\n\n\n### 5 simple tips to making responsive layouts the easy way\n Before writting any code, build a better mindset or approach to designing your website.\n\n#### Video (16 minutes)\n{% youtuber video VQraviuwbzU %}\n  allowfullscreen: 1,\n  autoplay: 0,\n  hl: en,\n  cc_lang_pref: en,\n  cc_load_policy: 1,\n  color: white,\n  controls: 1,\n  disablekb: 0,\n  enablejsapi: 1,\n  fs: 0,\n  iv_load_policy: 3,\n  loop: 0,\n  modestbranding: 1,\n  playsinline: 0,\n  privacy_mode: yes,\n  rel: 0,\n  showinfo: 0,\n  origin: blog.richiebartlett.com,\n  widget_referrer: blog.richiebartlett.com\n{% endyoutuber %}\n\n\n\n\n### Media queries & meta viewport\n Our phones assume that websites are NOT responsive, so if you don't tell them that you did all the hard work and set up some media queries, it'll just ignore all that and simply scale your website down to fit.

However, there are some limitations for images and other visual elements included in the email document. Another thing to consider is overall file size which must include all images. Very few providers allow large email sizes. So, keep this in mind while designing the email template.\n Design considerations should include whether to embed the images or to host them from your web servers. Know that hosted images are blocked from download by default from many email applications (for security reasons). However, embedded images are always displayed. Probably a good idea to keep the logo and any critical images embedded while the rest of the images are hosted.\n All CSS must be embedded as well. Not recommended to host this as there is limited support from email applications. Email applications also don't support a style section. All CSS must be *inline* with the elements. (This also increases the email size, unfortunately.)\n\n In general, you need several templates for your website:\n * Promotional / Marketing\n * Tranactional\n * Annoucement\n * Seasonal\n * Newsletter\n\n\n\n### The RIGHT WAY to create HTML emails\n  - Example template: https://mdbootstrap.com/freebies/emails/\n  - Test your emails *BEFORE* your users complain : https://putsmail.com/\n  - Designs known to get customers and engagement: https://www.LeadPages.net/\n  - Tool for marketing your emails: https://mailchimp.com/help/types-of-templates/\n\n\n#### Video (25 minutes)\n{% youtuber video sSNnixkKqcA %}\n  allowfullscreen: 1,\n  autoplay: 0,\n  hl: en,\n  cc_lang_pref: en,\n  cc_load_policy: 1,\n  color: white,\n  controls: 1,\n  disablekb: 0,\n  enablejsapi: 1,\n  fs: 0,\n  iv_load_policy: 3,\n  loop: 0,\n  modestbranding: 1,\n  playsinline: 0,\n  privacy_mode: yes,\n  rel: 0,\n  showinfo: 0,\n  origin: blog.richiebartlett.com,\n  widget_referrer: blog.richiebartlett.com\n{% endyoutuber %}\n\n\n\n\n### HTML Email Template Tutorial - Start to Finish with HTML & CSS\n In this responsive HTML email tutorial we'll build a complete mobile friendly HTML Email Template with Responsive HTML Tables and CSS.

Below are some vidoes I found to be immensely useful in catching up with the latest advancements. Yes... I binge-watched all these videos so I could apply the lessons to this website. \n \n Warning: this is a __very long__ post.

I'm familiar with Illustrator and have experience with Photoshop, but never really used XD. With the rebuild website project, I discovered its value and have started understanding how it makes the mock-up process so much faster. Previously, I just used my iPad and sketched out a bunch of stuff. With XD and the web-export plugin, I can rapidly build a site. This video covers that process.\n\n#### Video  (1 hour)\n{% youtuber video DaQx3ULPLRw %}\n  allowfullscreen: 1,\n  autoplay: 0,\n  hl: en,\n  cc_lang_pref: en,\n  cc_load_policy: 1,\n  color: white,\n  controls: 1,\n  disablekb: 0,\n  enablejsapi: 1,\n  fs: 0,\n  iv_load_policy: 3,\n  loop: 0,\n  modestbranding: 1,\n  playsinline: 0,\n  privacy_mode: yes,\n  rel: 0,\n  showinfo: 0,\n  origin: blog.richiebartlett.com,\n  widget_referrer: blog.richiebartlett.com\n{% endyoutuber %}\n\n\n\n### Convert Adobe XD to Responsive HTML\n I'm very interested in how to make a responsive website.

UX is more entrenched in behavioral pyschology than graphics design. Whereas a UI designer is more like a coder that is concerned with the interface elements. The UX designer would instruct the UI designer how best to engage the customers/users. In larger organizations, the roles around a website design are divided up among at least six different roles. However, in a startup (like what I do), I'm often that one person that does it all. However, I'm likely to outsource the visual/graphics design.\n\n### UX & UI\n{% gallery stretch, 2 %}\n![UX vs UI](./Researching-Blog-Design/UXvsUI.png)\n![Psychology vs Interface](./Researching-Blog-Design/ux-ui-diagram-corrected.png)\n![Roles: UX designer vs UI designer](./Researching-Blog-Design/UX-designer-Inforgraphic.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n### Video course (4 hours)\n{% youtuber video uL2ZB7XXIgg %} \n  allowfullscreen: 1,\n  autoplay: 0,\n  hl: en,\n  cc_lang_pref: en,\n  cc_load_policy: 1,\n  color: white,\n  controls: 1,\n  disablekb: 0,\n  enablejsapi: 1,\n  fs: 0,\n  iv_load_policy: 3,\n  loop: 0,\n  modestbranding: 1,\n  playsinline: 0,\n  privacy_mode: yes,\n  rel: 0,\n  showinfo: 0,\n  origin: blog.richiebartlett.com,\n  widget_referrer: blog.richiebartlett.com\n{% endyoutuber %}\n\n\n### Customers & Sales\n{% gallery stretch, 3 %}\n![Customer Journey](./Researching-Blog-Design/Customer_Journey.png)\n![Sales Funnel](./Researching-Blog-Design/UX-Design_Sales_Funnel.png)\n![3 Sales Funnel phases](./Researching-Blog-Design/3sales_funnel_phases.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n### Sales Funnel Stages\n{% gallery stretch, 3 %}\n![Sales stages](./Researching-Blog-Design/Sales_Funnel_stages.png)\n![Market Sophistication](./Researching-Blog-Design/Market_Sophistication.png)\n![Market Sophistication stages ](./Researching-Blog-Design/Stages_of_market_sophistication.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n### Lead Generation Funnel\n{% gallery stretch, 3 %}\n![Lead Funnels](./Researching-Blog-Design/Lead_Funnels.png)\n![Lead generation funnel](./Researching-Blog-Design/Lead_generation_funnel.png)\n![Digital Product funnel](./Researching-Blog-Design/Digital_Prod_funnel.png)\n![Digital Product funnel stages](./Researching-Blog-Design/Digital_Prod_funnel_stages.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n### Principles of Influence\n{% gallery stretch, 2 %}\n![Influence Principles](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence_Principles.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n### Age based Influence\n{% gallery stretch, 3 %}\n![Age Influence](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence-Age.png)\n![Age Influence Triggers: Gen X](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence-Age_Triggers_Gen-X.png)\n![Age Influence Triggers: Baby Boomers](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence-Age_Triggers_Boomers.png)\n![Age Influence Triggers: Millennials](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence-Age_Triggers_Millennials.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n### Gender based Influence\n{% gallery stretch, 3 %}\n![Gender Influence](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence-Gender.png)\n![Gender Influence: Male](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence-Gender_Male.png)\n![Gender Influence: Female](./Researching-Blog-Design/Influence-Gender_Female.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n### Interest based Marketing\nHere are some tools to use to determine the demographics available on Facebook / Instagram and elsewhere.\n- [FaceBook Insights](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/audience-insights)\n- [Instagram Insights](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/788388387972460)\n- [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/)\n- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/)\n\n{% gallery stretch, 2 %}\n![Interest Marketing](./Researching-Blog-Design/Interest_Marketing.png)\n{% endgallery %}\n\n\n\n## Typography\n As I have read a lot of books and online sites, I've observed a number of \"unwritten rules\" around the way information is presented.

So, I've watched this \"crash course\" on the topic.

Knowing how colors work together and what the different colors mean is key to creating beautiful designs.\n\n _NOTE_: Different cultures and languages have some very different color associations.

In this video, I take a quick look at the replacements you should be using instead, @use and @forward. I just scratch the surface in this one, but it should be enough to get you started!\n\n A quick note, if you are using node-sass, it is out of date and @use and @forward, as well as their entire module system, will not work. If you're using the Watch Sass extension in VS Code, there is no way to update it. If you are using npm or yarn, just switch out the install of node-sass for sass instead. \n\n Why Sass changed to Dart: https://sass-lang.com/blog/announcing-dart-sass\n\n#### Video (13 minutes)\n{% youtuber video CR-a8upNjJ0 %} \n  allowfullscreen: 1,\n  autoplay: 0,\n  hl: en,\n  cc_lang_pref: en,\n  cc_load_policy: 1,\n  color: white,\n  controls: 1,\n  disablekb: 0,\n  enablejsapi: 1,\n  fs: 0,\n  iv_load_policy: 3,\n  loop: 0,\n  modestbranding: 1,\n  playsinline: 0,\n  privacy_mode: yes,\n  rel: 0,\n  showinfo: 0,\n  origin: blog.richiebartlett.com,\n  widget_referrer: blog.richiebartlett.com\n{% endyoutuber %}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## SVG\n Scalar Vector Graphics\n\n### Design & Animate SVG Illustrations for Web Design\n How to design an isometric SVG illustration in Adobe Illustrator CC using 3D tools.

However, there are some limitations for images and other visual elements included in the email document. Another thing to consider is overall file size which must include all images. Very few providers allow large email sizes. So, keep this in mind while designing the email template.\n Design considerations should include whether to embed the images or to host them from your web servers. Know that hosted images are blocked from download by default from many email applications (for security reasons). However, embedded images are always displayed. Probably a good idea to keep the logo and any critical images embedded while the rest of the images are hosted.\n All CSS must be embedded as well. Not recommended to host this as there is limited support from email applications. Email applications also don't support a style section. All CSS must be *inline* with the elements. (This also increases the email size, unfortunately.)\n\n In general, you need several templates for your website:\n * Promotional / Marketing\n * Tranactional\n * Annoucement\n * Seasonal\n * Newsletter\n\n\n\n### The RIGHT WAY to create HTML emails\n  - Example template: https://mdbootstrap.com/freebies/emails/\n  - Test your emails *BEFORE* your users complain : https://putsmail.com/\n  - Designs known to get customers and engagement: https://www.LeadPages.net/\n  - Tool for marketing your emails: https://mailchimp.com/help/types-of-templates/\n\n\n#### Video (25 minutes)\n{% youtuber video sSNnixkKqcA %}\n  allowfullscreen: 1,\n  autoplay: 0,\n  hl: en,\n  cc_lang_pref: en,\n  cc_load_policy: 1,\n  color: white,\n  controls: 1,\n  disablekb: 0,\n  enablejsapi: 1,\n  fs: 0,\n  iv_load_policy: 3,\n  loop: 0,\n  modestbranding: 1,\n  playsinline: 0,\n  privacy_mode: yes,\n  rel: 0,\n  showinfo: 0,\n  origin: blog.richiebartlett.com,\n  widget_referrer: blog.richiebartlett.com\n{% endyoutuber %}\n\n\n\n\n### HTML Email Template Tutorial - Start to Finish with HTML & CSS\n In this responsive HTML email tutorial we'll build a complete mobile friendly HTML Email Template with Responsive HTML Tables and CSS.
