 I have finally started working on the user management system for this site. This means that once I finish this leg of development, users will be able to join and post to my blogs. The system will also provide tracking so I may disable/re-enable any user based on current site policies.
 
 I'm also considering a new face lift of my site. I may design a new theme that is more friendly to a larger plog/blog section...
 
Stay tuned to future developments!
