## Disclaimer
 First and foremost: I'm not a medical doctor. My experience should be held purely anecdotal. Please seek the professional advice of an accredited doctor with a specialty in nutrition. Furthermore, Vegan-based diets are not inheritedly healthier than any other lifestyle. It's perfectly possible to be a "fat, unhealthy vegan" living off "junk food." Conversely, living on an onmivorous diet with a *LOT* of excercise could enable one to enjoy a decent healthspan. 
 
 However, by living a Vegan lifestyle and being particularly mindful of your nutrition, you can enjoy an especially long healthspan as strongly suggested by Dr. Dean Ornish's book on "[The Blue Zones](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Zones-Second-Lessons-Longest/dp/1426209487)." Where we find the most centenarians grouped together on the planet.


## Journey to a Healthier Me

### The story of FAT Richie
 I have plenty of pictures of the ol' Fat Richie here: [FAT-Richie.html](/2012/1230/Life_生活/Health/FAT-Richie.html)

 My story starts well before I really got fat. Like most Americans, I grew-up with the propaganda on TV and the lobbied state funded meal plans sponsored by companies that put profits before health. Despite the school offering a health education class, they didn't truly teach nutrition. Either you got that education at home... or, you developed poor health. 

### Weight loss the "hard way"
 You can find all my posts about the exercises I did to drop over 50kg! [/category/Life-生活/Health/Weight-Loss/](/category/Life-生活/Health/Weight-Loss/)

 Needless to say, I did a lot of exercise while trying out different diets to see what worked.

### The slow road towards Veganism


#### Learning the nutrition lessons not taught in school


#### Self research
  //TODO: compile experience with your suppliments and medical data.
